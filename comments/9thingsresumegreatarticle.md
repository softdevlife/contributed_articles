Some feedback.   

Of all things I agree except leaving personal information out, especially information that represents our current character. Sometimes our hobbies and cultures that we believe are part of our passion. Your rational reasoning of saying/focusing that people put too much information on average, that it represents in many cases  "unnecessary", is very vague and questionable, especially for managerial and executive positions, which impact high level decision making. 

Whether those traits are potent or not, it doesn't matter, they can be tested whether they are right or not, by others giving feedback. I know society currently generalizes personal information in bad ways, but hiding it does not make it even better. Instead, the solution you provide, by default, implicitly, we give a final judgment that our personal information are "unnecessary". Do you think that is a good example to treat those traits of individuals in our life as "unnecessary"? Most of our life is within a  job, it is part of our personal journey, it is clashing to waste a big part of our time on stuff that has a high risk it does not match with our ideologies with the cultural organization because we didn't disclose them in the first place. 

Good advice if you have no other choice and hide who you really are for the sake of working for money. Bad advice if you want the fate to be on the hands of the employer you work for.   I think all information is relevant to our capacity and in one way or another, if the organization by default judges by first impressions by age and other stuff, there is no point for working for them in the first place.  

On that point though, It is okay to not put information that does not reflect your current character. People have to ask for themselves on the information they put in: Do I still do this hobby? How significant it is? That I agree. 

But people these days the information they hide to get a job is staggering, focusing only on their strengths. Then their average tenure in a job is 2 years. Let me tell you how many companies are displeased by the fact of the high turnover they have when candidates try to hide stuff because they think organizations will judge such information in a negative way. Then they find out that it is not a cultural fit for them and then they leave. I think for our current society on the pace of how much information they give about their character, disclosing personal information is more important than ever in order to have a healthy workforce in our labor market and being more social responsible.
