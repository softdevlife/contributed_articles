### Tempered Radical

In chapter 5 of the book Originals by Adam Grant, you can learn people being tempered radical. When you really want something and it fails because their expectations do not align with yours, you can still continue to strive to your current expectations by placing different motivations others will definitely be motivated for. If you have a great idea that you need others to help you, you do not have to convince others your idea to others is great, you just need to not discuss the details and let them do what they are already good at on contributing your cause without being aboard.

It is true that we should not be narrow-minded to the things we deeply care about do not get the light of day. We should instead untangle ourselves and see other ways we can add value to our society. But if you still find your current endeavors worthwhile even after evaluating your situation against other things that you could do, then it does not mean you should give up due to external influences. Sometimes people who give up too fast is not a good trait either because they usually do not have discipline when things get tough and are more prone to judging things from the cover of the book. It is great when people try new things they have never tried before, but it is even greater when people have the resilience to try something that they deeply care and evaluated carefully by not giving up from the influences of others and instead tried to traverse through their same ambitions by trying different approaches where it could work.
