## Alegory Of The Cave
*This comment was edited as it is stored in a closed group ([Philosophy of Mind in Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4011660)). Read the [Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave) from Wikipedia if you are unaware about the story.*

The story *Allegory of the Cave* was taught in one of my **Intro to Philosophy:Reality/Knowledge** classes in **San Diego City College**. The whole premise of the story is whether people will have a **fixed mindset** based on the empirical evidence they see. The mind is wired in such ways where when it receives empirical evidence, it has the choice to either:
* Validate them by replication in the empirical world (*An attempt to be rational*) 
* Be overwhelmed by emotions that the mind accepts the belief without the need for validation. (*An attempt to be irrational*)

The person has the freedom to do those two distinct choices. We have seen those two different pathways how they played out within civilization. The process of science advanced our civilization while the method of being overwhelmed by emotions (i.e. accepting the sun as the creator of *everything*) did not fair up well.

## The Return Of The Cave & Effect Of Cognitive Dissonance

If we talk about the *Return* of the *Allegory of the Cave*, what do you think the person that escaped is trying to conceive to the people that are in prison? It is admittedly a fairytale story. Why would they believe in something where the prisoners cannot replicate? However, the story can be tested on the waters when the escaped prisoner allows them the opportunity to become free where they have the ability to replicate it. The point is this access is instantaneous. If it took ten years or twenty years or an eternity to go to the other dimensional portal to access the truth, then the more chances it smells as a fad like Scientology.

However, discovering a new paradigm about life that is for our better, takes time, it has a personal cost. You cannot get the benefits in an instant. Books that say *Learn to do X in 24 hours* never keep that promise. However, we should be expecting some progress for every iteration we get access to a new paradigm. A fixed mindset emerges for most people due to: 
* Being accustomed to things emotionally
* By society pressures (also termed as *low links*)
* Avoiding financial hardships for being an outcast. 

That fixed mindset defends itself by cognitive dissonance instead of having an open mind by evaluating things. The people in the cave had a high risk to take. They would not bet on something more adventurous unless they were: 
* Bored 
* Felt they didn't feel their best with their current group 

How to avoid having a fixed mindset? The story teaches us: 
* To be curious and independent from low ties
* To not propel us to what rushes our dopamine cells every day. 

**Force to be bored with your current stuff and take a step backward.**  Maybe there are more amazing things that you won't find out when you only get excited with the current stuff. 

An analogy to that is how machine learning reaches to the optimal value through gradient descent. The optimal value we reach may be a local one and not the global one. We have to try other paths that can reach us to a better local one. The only way to do that is to look at the big picture instead of being narrow-minded to the only optimal value we can see within our scope.

Think the story of the tower of Babel which was attached only on creating the tallest building in the world. Think how the differences of each culture made us look beyond the local stuff that we are accustomed to. Interdisciplinary knowledge and observing a variety of cultures helped us to *think out of the box*.

## The Obstacles Of Reaching Platonic Forms & The Big Picture 
 
The *shadows* in the cave can also represent *images* of the platonic forms (the real people that create the shadows) that we will never reach. Do we have a presence of those platonic forms? Many people do not. They may think only of money, health, connections as their bottom line when performing their jobs. However, most founders who create startups and great institutions like healthcare and education did so for idealist views (the could visualize the real people behind the shadows). They knew that they will never reach those platonic forms, but as long they attempted to improve their structure of the organization (the shadows),  they would get closer and closer to the platonic form. Some organizations don't notice that and flip. They don't innovate. They look too narrow. Because the "real people" are beyond the realm of our world where we can see, we can only grasp them by thinking in the big picture. 

There are two things that can block us to learn and able to keep thinking about the big picture by default:
* We live in a physical world and we need to cater our basic needs.   
* It depends on how selfish we are in the things that we are closely attached, setting the big picture as a lower priority. 

Thus, it is very easy for most of us to focus very narrow on the shadows and ignore what is behind. 

## Our Better Ability To Grasp Platonic Forms Distinct Us From The Rest

Humans set aside from animals in one element: **We have the potential to not be attached too much on the shadows**. We see people that violate the laws of being attached to the shadows. People who play music or contribute to open source code with fewer rewards and with less recognition.  We have the **patience** that such rewards may not come in the short term but in the long term. The breadth of patience for some people can go as long to generations or beyond our chances of still having a livelihood. I think that is what differentiates us from the rest of the animal kingdom, that we have the choice to use our willpower to not succumb to some short term reward. Maybe that is the possibility the human mind has an easier grasp to get closer to the platonic forms, and with that, able to have more control of its surroundings instead of being controlled by the environment.

## Summary

Who can grasp beyond the shadows within the cave, depends on the person. Some of the factors that keep us in the shadows:
* Being dependent and attached to low links (family, friends, groups)
* Being excited only on the local stuff (nation, culture, norms)
* Not covering basic needs
* Being selfish on things that are closely attached to us, giving less priority on more important matters.

Also, before you are aware of the big picture, you need to train yourself to grasp it. 

## Epilogue 

> Socrates informs Glaucon that the most excellent people must follow the highest of all studies, which is to behold the Good. Those who have ascended to this highest level, however, must not remain there but must return to the cave and dwell with the prisoners, sharing in their labors and honors.

To some extent, I feel that I have a mental map of one of the highest level. I have two choices: 
* To either intellectually follow it for my own pursuits to gain wealth and do proper works  
* To teach it for others to follow. 

Teaching, being a mentor, is a very important thing. No matter what my works I do, if nobody knows the essence behind them, they will depend on me for my works, instead of the rest of the people becoming independent. We are machine learners where our goal is to: 
* Understand our environment in order to improve our physical life (we have capitalized on how to do iterative improvements on getting closer to that platonic form).
* Our selves in order to improve our relationship/communication with others (we are still in progress on this and my blog dedicates the most on that topic).

**It is the collective level forces that will trap the next generation**. Every person that contributes influencing the existing paradigm that the collective level has *for the better* **counts**.

For example, it will be pointless for if somebody implements only the scientific process of doing things without educating others about it. It will leave the next generations instead to worship the inventor as a special being instead of figuring out that anybody has the ability to become an image of him.

As to why we need to figure how things work in the first place, to paraphrase a great conversation one of our teachers in **MANAGERIAL STATISTICS** in **CAL POLY POMONA** said to us was:

> The best way a person learns stuff is not from giving a key on how to open the door, but leaving the person alone figure out which key opens the door

For that reason, I wrote [my blog](http://www.softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com) , as well currently writing a set of weekly digests recapping the main message of my blog with hashtag `#selfdevboostermentalmaptour` on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SoftDevLife) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/softdevlife), as well all accessible on [github](https://github.com/softdevlife/contributed_articles/tree/master/selfdevboostermentalmaptour) . I may (if I have support or a lot of free time) write a book that recaps the same thing about it within the next 10 years. Other than that, I think it is important to focus on intellectual pursuits and be a role model example for others to follow, as well most importantly **integrating it to our personal identity**, as described by the [ending post about personal development within my blog](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2016/08/mental-map-epilogue-motivation-two.html).
