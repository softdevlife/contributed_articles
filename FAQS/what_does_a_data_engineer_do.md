After working several years in different environments, I found that a data engineer does several tasks that differ from each other. These are the tasks that I think every data engineer should learn and be good at within his career:

1. **Data Exploration:** Write efficient queries that can deliver accurate results. It takes time to be proficient at doing the proper joins between tables and summarizing them in order to get useful results. Figuring out all the nook and crannies of how databases work comes only after working with them extensively.

2. **Data Pipelines:** The construction of efficient data infrastructures that are easy to maintain and can be used effectively. Being good at all the data operations (replicate, download, import, export) within the data infrastructure takes a while to master. To make infrastructures more efficient, it requires the knowledge of how each database operates and the different types of database models.

3. **Monitoring Tools:** Seamlessly spot and resolve any issue within the infrastructure. It takes dedication in keeping the code clean and organized while having the proper documentation in place. It also takes time on logging all activity while placing alarms. When several issues get found by surprise or become hard to resolve, a data engineer starts to appreciate in keeping things tidy.

4. **Productivity Tools:** Take less time on completing projects by having the proper mindset and work environment. Running tests or setting the results into a staging environment is better than deploying it to production that will require data fixes later on. Doing audit tests instead of full comprehensive tests will take less time for figuring out the root of the issue. Writing in interpreted languages instead of compiled languages delivers more features for the same amount of time.

5. **Automation & Innovation:** To automate mundane work so you can focus more time on adding value in new ways within your organization. Figuring out how to automate tasks requires knowledge of existing design patterns. These tasks can be automated by coding it or buying a product. Innovation is the task of improving things from many perspectives. It requires to be creative and doing a lot of experimentation.

6. **Communication:** Aligning stakeholders with their objectives, assist in data literacy and provide data access respective to their needs. Creating the proper dashboards for simple users and heavy-intensive database for analytic users takes a lot of time to set up. Training users and establishing agreements on the requirements require a lot of processes to be in place.

7. **Skills:** Having experience of all the tools and methods associated with the trade. Unlike other careers, data engineers need to learn continuously in order to stay relevant. Besides completing degrees and certificates, skills get polished the best when they get incorporated into side projects. Side projects help in filling out any gaps that we may miss during lectures.

8. **Motivation:** To have a general purpose in your work environment. Data engineering several tasks require problem-solving and being motivated helps in overcoming those obstacles seamlessly and with ease. There will always be something interesting to work if you research beforehand several projects within your organization and already found different ways of resolving them.

**In Practiceâ€¦**

1. Not all organizations need you to know all the aspects that we have discussed so far. They may need data engineers that:

* Know how to explore data to create reporting modules.
* Can create data pipelines to deliver data marts.
* Able to communicate with stakeholders to implement several business requirements.
* Have their skills up to date.

It all depends on what type of business they operate and what they currently need.

2. For a Junior Data Engineer, this list may be too overwhelming. During your career, you should start learning one topic at a time until you feel you have covered most of it.

3. Think of Data Engineering like a soccer match. Not all are attackers, neither all are defenders, even star players on the midfield may not be proportionally all good on the different type of tasks that we have just described so far. Accept to what they are good at and make use out of that.

**Conclusion**

Data Engineers need to be good at data exploration, create data pipelines, have appropriate monitoring & productivity tools, automate & innovate, communicate well with stakeholders, learn the latest tools and methods associated with their trade, and be motivated.

Did you have fun reading my answer to what a Data Engineer does? Did you like the presentation slide I provided? If so, you can read [my full-length article on Medium about the eight traits we just discussed that a data engineer has to master along with his journey](https://medium.com/@SoftDevLife/how-to-master-the-basics-of-data-engineering-7a16244dd148). Although my Medium article is a very long read, I incorporated a lot of fun informative slides.
