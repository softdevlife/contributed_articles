## Motivation

In the event our journey comes to a roadblock, there are two ways a person can keep himself moving forward on their adventure: Traverse through the roadblock or find another road. In other words, you have to choose experimentation or persistence.

### Experimentation

The easiest way to be motivated is to find another path when the current path does not work. That is what people do by default to keep themselves motivated. If current circumstances do not work as expected, we say sorry to our self and others and try again in a different way. When we experiment solutions, there are better chances of finding the right fit to our problem. After all, a piece of puzzle takes several tries to find out where it correctly fits. In addition, you get access to diverse background points of views. In summary, it works well if you want to be motivated for short sprints.

However, experimentation has its drawbacks. When I mean "experimentation", I do not mean tackling a roadblock in a different approach, but disregarding the roadblock by finding alternative ways to solve your original problem. The more experimental, the less you will be persistent when current circumstances are not in your favor. When we become too experimental, we start to have a lower threshold when things do not go our way and become more narrow-minded by judging things from the cover of the book. Furthermore, our views often underestimate things because we observe things from a shallow perspective. In addition, our speculations for the things we disapprove is derived from incomplete data. It is more like we overgeneralize. Last but not least, our observations come from a pool of limited domain knowledge. Thus, we become less committed and aware of the big picture. In summary, this does not work well if you want to be motivated for something that you want to keep doing for the long-term.

### Persistence

Persistence is never good when there is something better around the block than what we currently offer. We need to untangle ourselves into new perspectives from time to time through experimentation.

However, if our views are evaluated properly by being open-minded through the other roads that are on offer and trying each of them out, then persistence is not a bad path to take. Sometimes, an idea can be underestimated because others have not gone too deep down the rabbit hole to see what the other side offers. Maybe they are too busy with their own belongings that they did not have as much time to occupy their minds on the idea as much as you have observed. The most valuable and meaningful ideas come through persistence. It is persistent people who try different approaches on any roadblock they encounter on their current path. I think this type of motivation is not only meaningful but more authentic.

### Conclusion

I started talking about how experimentation works well, but not so well if it was run on its own. Then, I started talking about how persistence alone keeps us isolated from the rest of the views that can add more value, but when that does not happen, it is the only way in bringing long last benefits to our society.

Motivation can be immediate by either being isolated to our views (extreme persistence) or being impatient and overgeneralize our past experiences (extreme experimentation). However, if motivation is taken by the happiness of pursuit than happiness itself, we take the best for what experimentation and persistence offer us: Being open-minded to all views and prioritizing the one that will have long-term meaningful outcomes than the ones that will be short-lived.

Parting words of _Originals_ by Adam Grant are so compelling, it evokes us to take a second glance on defining what happiness is all about.

> In the quest of happiness, many of us choose to enjoy the world as it is...(while others) striving to make the world what it "could" be...(they) may temporarily give up some pleasure...not the easiest path in the pursuit of happiness, but it leaves us perfectly poised for the happiness of pursuit (Originals,242-243)
