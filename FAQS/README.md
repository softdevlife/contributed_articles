There are people that they would ask me: 
1. Why did I create a blog filled with self-improvement books? 
2. Why did you choose to read books in the first place? 
3. Did any of the books help you out? 

I started my blog as a diary in order to find out what I was most deeply curious about. I found out that I was deeply obsessed on how to optimize human behavior. I knew my personal experiences were limited on expanding that topic so I chose self-improvement books as a source of inspiration. 

I found that among all mediums, books, in general, are the best idea generators. Out of the many mediums of expressing an idea, books are the best in quality on expressing an idea thoroughly. If music changes your mood, a book changes your mindset.

In most self-improvement books, you will find something enlightening that you never did know before. If I had to recommend one book to others, I would choose Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed. It is a great all-in-one book on having better perspectives when you evaluate the current problems we have in today's society and the different ways you can add value to them.
