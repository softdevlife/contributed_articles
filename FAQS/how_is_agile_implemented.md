Look at the picture **[1]** above. Do you see that the road above is not **straight** to our destination? In real life, all outcomes cannot be based on our current expectations. In order to reach our destination, we have to adjust our plans to new situations we have not taken account of. In other words, we have to slow down in order to pass through the **curves** smoothly. **Agile is all about getting to your destination with the least fuss while riding the road.**

The more times we ignore the curves and crash the rails, the more damage the car will get and the less it will be able to reach to its destination. Our car gets more damage the more **technical debt** we accumulate. That happens when:

* Requirements for new features are not clear.
* Most do not know exactly what the existing software does.
* Adding features with existing processes take longer than usual.

In those occasions, you have to **slow down enough** that you do not crash and go off the rails. Pay more attention to your surroundings and keep the pedal on hold until you are ahead of the curve.

**Once things look clear**, you can keep the pedal on and **run as fast as you can** as long that road looks straight. However, donâ€™t expect that ride will always be smooth. Keep your flashlights on and expect to encounter some more curves along the road. However, don't give that as the main reason for driving your car slow. By the time you reach your destination, nobody will be there waiting for you.

All this driving is pointless if people do not have an internal purpose for reaching to the destination. To have a purpose on our journey, we incorporate a story within our requirements. **We must really care of our adventure amid all the obstacles we will encounter ahead of our road.** So make sure the back of your car has something valuable that you want to deliver. Otherwise, you will just stop in the middle when things become difficult.
