In the image above, you see a developer (one that builds the product) and a stakeholder (one that observes whether the product is a good fit).

What is so striking to this image is not the occurrence, but how long that occurrence lasts.

Does it last for a:

* Few minutes?
* Hours?
* The whole day?

In most workplace environments, developers and stakeholders sit together for a few minutes. It is rare to sit together for hours, don't even ask for a full day.

The feat of working together for a whole day is called [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). It is a rare state where everything is ideal on getting the product done on the fly.

The feat is impossible to do these days. In most occurrences, the stakeholder does not know the entire requirements or the developer has to catch up with new situations he never handled before. In those cases, both have to go back to their own drawer and refine their expertise on troubleshooting their congestion.

That is why at this moment we use productivity tools to the above bottlenecks, such as:

* [JIRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)): Organizes business domain knowledge.
* [GITHUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub): Organizes technical knowledge.
* [SLACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)): Asynchronous communication for organizing meetings and troubleshooting issues that are clear to communicate.

**But we should still try to strive on making our meetings seem like we are doing extreme programming as that is the ideal state for getting projects done.**
### Getting Projects Done

At the general level, it all boils to one basic element: **Passion**.

You definitely need to have a purpose for completing a project. Sometimes a project can start with a lousy purpose. In the end, those project's architecture will get what they actually deserve which you can play a part of it.

Take for instance:

* Nuclear Bombs vs. Nuclear Energy
* Graphics Cards Used For Video Games vs. Graphics Cards Used For Machine Learning
* How mobile hit games [Game Of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_War:_Fire_Age) and [Mobile Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Strike) was used as a proof of concept to enable [smart city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city) solutions **[1]**

At the detail level, three components matter. These are:

* **Resources**: At any point of time, we are encountered with limited resources. We have to optimize our resources to provide a product that differentiates from the rest, but not so much that we lose track of the main vision of the product. Computer scientists evaluate the performance of their algorithms with [Big-O Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). In most cases, it is very easy to differentiate the tasks between the ones that take between hours and minutes. All the stuff that has low-performance today will have high performance later on. For instance, when I tried to migrate a ms-dos reporting system to a windows reporting system, the time difference it took to generate a very simple report was between half an hour and a few seconds. Similarly, we see a lot of big data and data science stuff taking hours and days due to the expensive costs of current resources. In a few decades, those will be done in seconds. I cannot imagine how people who used the ms-dos reporting system were productive. The time they had to wait to get feedback from the system to adjust their project operations is a big waste of time. Imagine the current resource constraints you have within your organization that blocks your time that you always took it for granted.
* **Business Domain**: Expertise of the business domain and transfer of knowledge is a difficult task, especially when companies face high attrition rate. A good way for people to learn the business domain knowledge of an organization is to take good examples of how video games immerse us to their world. Take for instance games like [SimCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity) and [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)). Their system is complex to learn, but compelling due to how the tutorials and goals are organized by placing them with the correct steep curve. Can organizations imitate that so employees can be master of their craft?
* **Technical Domain**: This is important as speaking a language. If you cannot speak the language of your craft, you cannot build anything. Sure, anybody can definitely build something by copying and pasting something from the internet. However, the more you know about the language of your craft, the more creative, original, and robust will be the solutions that you provide.
