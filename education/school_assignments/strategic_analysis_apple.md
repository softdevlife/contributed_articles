### Introduction
Apple, an electronic company with its headquarters in California, USA, is popular for selling personal computers, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, and software. Apple is one of the companies that first brought to the consumer market personal computers, graphic user interfaces, color display, hard drive, and floppy drives. It all started in 1976, where Steve Jobs introduced the Apple Computer in a computer club. In half a year they had 10 retail stores selling the computer kits and after a year they introduced the second version of Apple computer called the “Apple II”, with features such as “color graphics, audio capabilities, and fully-documented hardware specs that encouraged third-party accessories, the Apple II became the most popular computer of all time, selling for over 15 years” ("What is apple?," 24 ).
<br><br>After Apple downfall, Apple lately began to get in the software industry with its Apple store, selling software music and video. Although for compatibility reasons Apple introduced the QuickTime and iTunes to windows computers, most of the software distributed is for the OS-X operating system, which can only work on Macintosh computers that are made from Apple ("What is apple?," 24 ).
<br><br>Apple most of its revenue in the last years came from the iPod player device and the iTunes music and video store for users to buy content for their iPod. In 2007, they introduced the iPhone, with anticipations that it would become out of stock, making it the most expensive and demanding product. The releases of these 2 products were the ones that brought Apple back to its “profits and brand recognition”. In the past, Apple focused only on computers, but now they opened their vision more broadly to accommodate any “electronics and media distribution” as their main operational business. ("What is apple?," 24 ).

### Industry Analysis
Datamonitor has analyzed the external environment Apple is facing. In summary, Apple has opportunities in creating new digital platforms for their video content and still maintaining domination and having the competitive edge in areas of wireless networks and the mp3 player market. Wireless and network products are expected to be in big demand. Apple has already invested a lot of money beforehand to be able to take a share market in that area. For instance, Apple has the wireless network technology called “AirPort” which uses the IEEE 802.11b standard which allows “wireless communications within a radius of approximately 150 feet from an AirPort base station”. In addition, Apple will now offer their video content by iTunes on Mac devices, such as television and any other portable device. This will bring more customers who own such devices to access their video content. Last but not least, Apple’s MP3 market is in steady growth from having “market share increased to 78% in March 2006 from 71% in December 2005 “. However, in terms of international performance it falls behind with “40% in the UK, 54% in Japan, 45% in Canada, and 58% in Australia.” ("Apple inc swot," 2006)
<br><br>Although Apple has a lot of advantages ahead for keeping revenue, it still has 2 threats that Apple will have to overcome: the strong competition of other companies selling substitute or alternative products that can meet the same features apple does at a cheaper price and the issue of their high price tag to not meet the personal income of a European citizen as the Eurozone economy is growing slow. That is one reason many of its music sales, such as in their iTunes store, is not easy for the average European citizen to spend much money as an American can do. First of all, as Apple is a technology industry, technological innovations in hardware and software release fast, with new products, price shifts, and new features shown every year. Apple’s biggest competitors are the Windows personal computers which prices are lowered with cutting the costs of production in order to gain a big part of the market share. Although apple’s high price tag reflects the quality of their product, it will be “adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.” Apple’s second key market was Europe to sell its products, but a new economic uncertainty of Europe’s future will reduce the purchasing power of its citizens in “information technology products”. The economy of Europe has political instability, more unemployment than it used before, the increasing prices of oil, and with expectations for a house price bubble to burst in the future. The Eurozone GDP “growth for the year 2005 was estimated at 1.3%, as compared with 2.1% in 2004” ("Apple inc swot," 2006)
<br><br>Last but not least, Apple is facing a lot of lawsuits, such as “patent infringement, false advertising, and unfair business practices”. Recently, they had a lawsuit by “Apple Corps, started by the Beatles in 1968, (which) argues that Apple Computer has infringed its territory by entering the music business and is seeking to force Apple Computer to drop its apple logo from the iTunes Music Store and pay damages”. These lawsuits cannot only affect the reputation and brand of Apple, but also its financial health by paying the damages and any other liabilities. ("Apple inc swot," 2006)

### Internal Environment
Apple's organization structure since it has been a company run by engineers and programmers instead of managers – even though these people such as Steven Jobs are skilled managers. Apple used the "Matrix structure" of management when the company became larger. According to Learn Management, "A Matrix structure organization contains teams of people created from various sections of the business. These teams will be created for the purposes of a specific project and will be led by a project manager." Top management hands out strategic decisions to project managers and different departments to be carried out. The project managers then devise an operational plan and then coordinate their units to successfully carry it out. The department’s managers are consulted to provide budgeting, scheduling, market analysis, etc to back a particular project.  With the positions of "Chief Executive Officer of Apple, chief financial officer, senior vice president of world-wide affairs, general counsel, senior VP and worldwide sales, Senior VP hardware engineering, Senior VP and software engineering" , the company wants an internal strategy to function with the matrix structure. The official departments that make up the matrix structure for Apple are Finance, Sales, Hardware Engineering, and Software Engineering. This structure is clearly understood by everyone in the whole company. Additionally, the current structure is consistent with current corporate objectives and strategies because Apple’s current focus has been on increasing sales through software and hardware engineering. This is similar to many other computer companies in the business such as IBM and Compaq (Sharma).

### Vision, Mission, and Objectives
Apple's vision started when the company ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and soon in the 1980s reinvented the personal computer with the Macintosh.  As stated by Brainmass, "Apple is committed to bringing the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals, and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software, and Internet Offerings."  According to Apple Computer's mission statement, the company is committed to protecting the environment, health and safety of our employees, customers and the global communities 'where we operate. We recognize that by integrating sound environmental, health and safety management practices into all aspects of our business, we can offer technologically innovative products and services while conserving and enhancing resources for future generations. Apple strives for continuous improvement in OUF environmental, health and safety management systems and in the environmental quality of our products, processes and services (“Apple's vision/ mission,”,  2005)

### Strategies
According to The Best Article, Apple's strategizes to make life easier for both company and consumers alike.  Apple's business strategy focuses on making the best product, and rewards will follow. In fact, Apple's new partners are signing up in spite of, rather than because of, Jobs' rules of engagement. Apple makes little pretense of building a level playing field, but routinely picks favorites—such as Google for building mapping and video applications for the iPhone. And rather than aim for the most partners, Apple focuses on attracting the best ones. As a result, the Mac and iPod feel more like a gated, elitist community, with Apple keeping close watch over who gets in. Silicon Valley financier Roger McNamee said "The notion of a platform is a very PC-oriented way of looking at the world.  Consumers just want a great experience. They don't buy platforms" (“Welcome to planet,” , 2007).
<br><br>The Best Articles provides effective strategies that apple uses.  Those strategies are the following: 
1.  **A store just for Apple:** Apple stores are a friendly place where Mac and PC users alike are encouraged to play with and explore the technology that the company offers… This is a space where people can not only get service but also hang out with others who enjoy Apple products just as much as they do. By creating this space, Apple encourages current and new customers to get excited about what it has to offer ("12 effective strategies," ).
2.  **Complete solutions:** Apple’s products complement and complete each other. Buy an iPod, and you can download music via iTunes. For the average user, most Mac programs are produced by Apple. This sort of control over the entire user process, from hardware to software, strengthens customer loyalty. Apple users generally don’t have to stray to find products and solutions they want ("12 effective strategies," ).
3.  **Varied products:** Many consumers may not be ready to buy an Apple computer, but they’re willing to give gadgets like the iPod or iPhone a try. By selling products with lower entry costs, it creates an opportunity for new users to be introduced to Apple. If these users enjoy their gadgets, they’re more likely to consider buying an Apple computer in the future ("12 effective strategies," ).
4.  **Proprietary formats:** Apple products are often not compatible for use with other systems, at least where customer transitions are concerned. If a user has a digital music collection comprised entirely of .aac files, it’s not likely he’ll want to start from scratch with a new MP3 player that won’t accept them. ("12 effective strategies," ).
5.  **Media fodder:** Media outlets, especially bloggers, love to write about Apple. Why? Because Apple makes it so easy. With leaked rumors about new developments, its very own expo and mysterious shutdowns of its online store, Apple gift wraps news stories that are just begging for speculation and hype. By perpetuating this cycle of media frenzy, Apple reminds its customers that they’re excited about buying new Apple products now and in the future ("12 effective strategies," ).
6.  **Education sales:** By selling its products to schools and universities, Apple turns classrooms into showrooms. If students go through school using Apple products, they become comfortable with the interface and familiar with the superior performance the brand offers. By creating this early exposure, Apple captures customers before they even know that they are customers ("12 effective strategies," ).
7.  **Products that deliver:** Apple carefully considers what consumers are looking for, so its products are a result of both extensive research and strong design. This meticulous planning is a large contributor to Apple’s high customer-satisfaction rates. It’s plain and simple: robust and easy-to-use products not only make your customers happy, but also make them want to buy more products from you in the future ("12 effective strategies," ).
8.  **Outsourcing unpleasantness:** With Apple products, the average consumer’s interaction with the company is likely to be low. Unless something goes wrong, you don’t have any reason to speak with an Apple customer service representative. Of course, the iPhone presented an opportunity that could have made Apple much more involved, similar to administering iTunes for the iPod. With a phone, interaction becomes multifaceted. ("12 effective strategies," ).
9.  **Consistency:** All of Apple’s products have the same basic architecture. Because of this consistency, customers who already own Apple products have a good idea of what they’ll be getting before they make a purchase. They know that it will be easy to adapt to new hardware, and this makes them more open to making a repeat purchase ("12 effective strategies," ).
10. **New innovations:** Although the architecture of Apple products is consistent, its portfolio is not. The company offers consumers a number of different ways to enjoy its products. By giving customers an opportunity to employ Apple in their living rooms, pockets and offices, Apple makes it easy to stay loyal to a brand they already like ("12 effective strategies," ).
11. **Attractiveness:** From packaging to aesthetic design to user-interface experience, Apple makes its products accessible and attractive. Bright colors, a smiling icon and slick-looking hardware remind customers every time they use Apple products that what Apple offers is appealing ("12 effective strategies," ).

### Evaluation and Control
Apple had a lot of problems in the past. Steve Jobs had to do a lot of stuff to get the company back to its tracks. In the Info Tech article, it is summarized that near the end of the 1980s, they started to lose a lot of the market segment when John Sculley under 1987 said that "there is no home-computer market." Many of the computer games created by EA in the 1980s were for the MAC, but due to Apple's transition avoiding the consumer market, EA shifted its games on PCs. One of the interesting thing Steve Jobs ways of evaluating their company is looking at its past mistakes and taking fast correction as possible. In this above case, Steve Jobs had to fix this loss of their market segment in the past by making their products more compatible to the consumer market. In 2003, he made iTunes (the popular software where you can buy music tracks to listen on your iPod) to also be accessible for windows devices (in the past it was only exclusive for the mac). At that time, 98% of computer users had windows computers, making the sales of the iPod to skyrocket. Another transition they made was to use Intel CPU processors than the IBM PowerPC processors that they used for a long time. This made it easy for game developers like EA to make the PC games compatible also for the MAC, as the co-founder of EA said "it should be cheaper to churn out Mac games than, say, adapting them to game consoles like the Sony (SNE ) PlayStation or Nintendo (NTDOY ) Wii” ("Welcome to planet," 2007).
<br><br>When Apple encounters a problem, Apple always learn from their mistakes and fix them on their next release and adds new features other competitors don't have. When Apple started to get into creating laptop devices, their first release named "Macintosh Portable" was a failure because it weighted 16 to 17 lbs. In 1991, they introduced the PowerBook which weighted less than 8lbs, and had all the features a normal desktop had at that time, something that Compaq and Toshiba laptops at that time didn't offer hard drive and mouse ("Birth of the," 2005).
<br><br>In addition, Apple is very fast in addressing problems without any delay. Even lately, when Apple failed to create the cloud service MobileMe in 2008, the problem is addressed very fast. When Steve Jobs talked to the group in charge, he said “You’ve tarnished Apple’s reputation…You should hate each other for having let each other down…". Steve jobs placed a new executive for the project and most of the members of the team got replaced. It is reported that in 2011, the new cloud service now named as "iCloud" will bring a better features and accessibility from the MobileMe ("Furious steve jobs," 2011).

### Corporate governance 
New issues arise with Apple lately, such as the issue of privacy, violating the 4th amendment. For instance, there is the controversy that the Apple iPhone can "tracks and stores users' movements in an unprotected way".  Although Apple has privacy policy and can apply it to fix their ethical issues, let us see how Apple addressed government issues in the past ("Google, apple grilled," 2011).
<br><br>Apple tries to have codes and standards in place to comply corporate governance. When an issue arises, they try to address it as quickly as possible. For instance, news broke out in 2006 that the Chinese plant that creates the iPod places its workers to get paid only $50 a month and work in 15 hour shifts while living in poor conditions. In addition to that, the management of the plant placed the 2 reporters in a $3.8 million defamation sue. Apple did an audit of the plant in 6 weeks and found out that the workers worked more than 60 hours per week and they were living in poor houses, violating the working codes of Apple. Apple fixed the issue fast by making management agree to place new housing for the employees and for each worker to work for no more than 60 hours per week. In addition, they pushed management to lift sue against the 2 reporters they placed as all they did was to report facts (Hill, 2009).
<br><br>However, Apple doesn't have the choice to be able to regularly monitor any upcoming issues. For instance, for the workers in China, they wouldn't know the plant violated their work code until it was reported by those 2 journalists. However, they try to take corrective action as fast as possible. In another case, the government can also give issues to Apple for their electronic products to be dangerous, such as the Japan government pressuring Apple that their first iPod Nano overheats, with the consequence of having high risk of catching fire (Jordan, 2010). Apple created this page “http://www.apple.com/support/contact” for a full listing of the many ways a consumer can communicate to Apple for an issue like the above. Apple also tries to find the issue as fast as possible. They created a support page for the issue of the iPod overheating, telling consumers that it only comes from a single battery supplier that causes this issue on devices that were sold between 2005 and 2006 ("iPod nano (1st," 2011).

### Social Responsibility
![philanthropy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12673581/34071485-e4a060d8-e2b1-11e7-8e58-fd053aaaf17a.png)
<br> _The picture above shows the donations in cash and other type of non-cash donations per year from companies that are on the same industry as Apple (Cortez, 2010)_
<br><br>Although Apple has discounts for students buying an apple laptop, there is not a lot to speak about. Apple does not give any grants or any foundation for social support or any discount to their product other than to students. Rosita Cortez, founder of the “social media 4 nonprofits”, states that “Apple has been called out as one of the America’s least philanthropic companies”. She also provides a chart showing that other companies on the same industry as Apple, the amount of donations they give per year (Cortez, 2010).
<br> ![audit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12673581/34071583-0547a426-e2b3-11e7-96a6-571863977519.png)
<br> _Apple audits use the above model to resolve an issue within 90 days ("Auditing for compliance,",  2011)._
<br><br>Rather than Apple donating its money and giving discounts, Apple’s direction to social responsibility is to invest in an auditing programs with its mission to place workers in “safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes”. Their new program of auditing ensures that their mission of having good relations with their workers and the natural environment is regularly checked and resolved any issue within 90 days ("Auditing for compliance,",  2011).

### Conclusion
In summary, we saw Apple downturn due to the tight competition in the technology industry was recovered by having a broader vision in getting in new markets, such as wireless technology and portable devices, such as the iPod and iPhone. Apple's present brand recognition would not have been without their products to be attractive while adding innovative features in their products, easy and familiar to use, and to market to students. Although Apple has done a lot of mistakes in the past, it fixes them and addresses them quickly. In terms of violating government terms, Apple has standards of code which implements them after a quick audit that takes no more than 90 days. Apple may not be philanthropic like other companies in the same industry, but in the end it tries its plants to be environmentally friendly and its workers to be treated well while working in safe conditions.
