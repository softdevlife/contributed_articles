It is time to get a little bit more technical folks! Two weeks ago, I recommended for people to read the book *Executive Paradox by practical researcher David G. Jensen*. This book resonates the closest to the diagram of **Mental Symmetry**. As the book is meant for people who use leadership skills in their day-to-day life, it illustrates how the **Contributor** cognitive style behaves. The main things that we map are:

* **Rational**: With the `main` consciousness of **Perceiver** cognitive style
* **Empowering**: With **Perceiver** having `access` to **Mercy** Cognitive style
* **Commanding**: With the `main` consciousness of **Server** cognitive style
* **Visionary**: With **Server** having `access` to **Teacher** Cognitive style
* **Tasks**: The process and storage of **Teacher Mental Networks**
* **People**: The process and storage of **Mercy Mental Networks**

In addition, we learn:

* The reasons why people snap instead of stretch
* Why the lines **Tasks** and **People** cross and are independent of each other instead of stretching together in today's society

As to why I correlate the theory of **Mental Symmetry** with **Executive Paradox**:

>A theory is the more impressive...
the more different the kinds of things it relates
and the more extended the range of its applicability

>ALBERT EINSTEIN

**Executive Paradox** shows how to balance **Tasks** and **People**, but not integrating them. However, balancing **Tasks** and **People** are still very essential. The video slideshow bellow shows how integrating is possible.

We already discussed how to balance **People** by being **Empowering** from *I.M. Panagiotopoulos Modern Man* and **Psychological Safety** from *Charles Duhigg Smarter, Faster, Better*. On the next several weeks, we will see:

* **Agile Methodology** in the *software development life cycle* helps balance **Tasks**.
* *Feedback Revolution by Peter Mclaughlin* tells us how to communicate to balance **People**.
* *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed* and *Natural Cognitive Theology by Lorin Friesen* bring the problem and the solution in detail correspondingly on how to integrate **People** and **Tasks**.
