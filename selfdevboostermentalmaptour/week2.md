The book *Smarter, Faster, Better by Charles Duhigg* mentions **Psychological Safety** as one of the main productivity traits within organizations. Summarized, psychological safety is being **empowering** in others' terms views. Quoting:

>It always stuck Julia as odd that those two teams felt so different. Her study group felt stressful because everyone was always jousting for leadership and critiquing each other's ideas. Her case competition team (which won 1st place) felt exciting because everyone was so supportive and enthusiastic. Both groups, however, were composed of basically the same kinds of people.

The above quote resonates personally to me as well. In my 2011 class *ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING FOR BUSINESS at Cal Poly Pomona*, we were able to create a Facebook clone from scratch with Java meeting all the requirements of the project specifications within 3 days only. The feat was accomplished because we all focused on doing our tasks with our complimentary strengths with the least friction as possible, as discussed in my post: http://ow.ly/SltH303cFTv

For problems that are not very complicated in nature, being **empowering** alone works very well. However, there are many situations that people abuse the power to empower others in order to cover up real detrimental problems within organizations. As in the book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed* discuss, the norms of the hospital on how they reacted to mistakes lead for hospital mistakes to be one of the top 3 causes of people's death.
