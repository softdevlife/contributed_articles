### Reader's Digest On Being Agile

Previously, we discussed the ways to use the *Executive Paradox Model by David G Jensen* to keep **Tasks** running smoothly. The several projects we discussed last week turned bleak. It showed how delicate the process is.

The good news is that any organization can make a turn around of that mess, no matter what their current situation is. Take for instance **Sentinel**, an FBI analysis case management system that for several years wasted hundred millions of taxpayer money with no end in sight. Until **Agile** came and saved the day. But as the article quotes:

> The billion-dollar question: What's their secret? How can an organization as large and bureaucratic as the U.S. government, burdened by a labyrinthine procurement infrastructure and a history of large-scale IT project failures, manage to achieve such notable success with agile?

The jackpot to that answer is to focus on whatever makes the **Tasks** flow continuously by keeping technical debt at bay while meeting client business needs. Following only **agile methodology** can lure up a lot of technical debt leaving us with a sour taste experience. That can lead to people closing the curtains for what agile really is and complain that it doesn't work for them. Quoting:

> "Strive to be more agile, rather than simply following agile methods and steps." In other words, dont just use agile, be agile. Adoption of the philosophy of agile is more important than following the specific steps of agile.

If anything we can learn, **methodology** and **process** are different beasts. **Methodology** discusses a certain way of doing things. In contrast, a **process** discusses a philosophy that tries to reach a certain **platonic form** (i.e. In **Agile**, it means how to keep **Tasks** run smoothly). A **methodology** is a prescription how to reach to that **platonic form**. However, if we don't read our situation and we focus only on the **methodology**, we can deviate away from the end goal of the **platonic form**  (We will discuss **platonic forms** later when we start discussing the book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed*).

A great illustration explaining the difference between **methodology** and **process** is how Science is practiced these days.  Following the **process** of Science advanced our civilization and well-being in several ways. However, how scientific journals are published these days, requiring scientists to follow specific norms without evaluating them whether they deviate the original purposes Science was meant for, can stray us away from its ultimate goal as described [in this article](https://medium.com/the-spike/how-a-happy-moment-for-neuroscience-is-a-sad-moment-for-science-c4ba00336e9c#.m3mnv113j), quoting:

>  It is a striking case-study in how modern science is worryingly broken, because it prioritises private achievement over the public good.

## Sensitivity - A Review On The Female Brain
This week, I am going to talk about **sensitivity**. When we communicate, our dialogue has always some form of giving feedback to others. The way we convey the message, our self-reflection and our attitude towards the recipient are critical factors of a healthy dialogue. Communication will be discussed next week from the book *Feedback Revolution by Peter McLaughlin*. This week, we are going to discuss **sensitivity**.

**Sensitivity** exists within **Mercy** and **Teacher** cognitive modules that contain emotions within the amygdala of the brain. It seems that the mind `promotes` better **Mercy** and **Teacher** cognitive modules in the **Female Brain**. On the other hand, **Server** and **Perceiver** cognitive modules that have access to **Teacher** and **Mercy** Cognitive modules are more `promoted` within the **Male Brain**. This makes **Female Brain** to be more sensitive on **Mercy** and **Teacher mental networks** while the **Male Brain** affecting (destroying and replacing with new) **Mercy** and **Teacher mental networks**. That does **not** mean the **Female Brain** is `trapped` on specific cognitive modules that are promoted with neurochemicals. It just means that each gender has a competitive advantage hardware wise. It is all up to us software wise how we outcompete others.

This can be found in detail, as I quote from the book:

>In the brain centers for language and hearing, for example, women have 11 percent more neurons than men. The principle hub of both emotions and memory formation -the hippocampus- is also larger in the female brain, as is the brain circuitry for language and observing emotions of others ("language" and "observing emotions" of others correspond to Teacher and Mercy cognitive modules). This means that women are, on average, better at expressing emotions and remembering the details of emotional events. Men, by contrast, have two and a half times the brain space devotes to sexual drive as well as larger brain centers for action and aggression ("Action" and "Aggression" can correspond to Server and Perceiver cognitive modules correspondingly).

>Men also have larger processors in the core of the most primitive area of the brain, which registers fear and triggers aggression-the amygdala. This why some men can go from zero to a fistfight in a matter of seconds, while many women will try anything to defuse conflict. But the psychological stress of conflict registers more deeply in the areas of the female brain.

>Our distinct female and male brain operating systems are mostly compatible adept, but they perform and accomplish the same goals and tasks using different circuits. In a German study, researchers conducted brain scans of men and women while they mentally rotated abstract, three-dimensional shapes. There were no performance differences between the men and women, but there were significant, sex-specific differences in the brain circuits that activated to complete the task. Women triggered brain pathways linked to visual identification and spent more time than men picturing the objects in their minds. This fact merely meant that it took women longer to get to the same answer. It also showed that females perform all the cognitive functions males peform - they just do so by using different brain circuits.

## Demistifying The Gender Gap - Socrates Wisdom On Relationships

We all have a **Mercy** component, whether we are male or female, we all get affected by some form of **sensitivity**. We have to respect the hardware difference and the neurochemicals that exist between the male and female gender. Being in denial is being unscientific and it will hurt decisions that alter the original truth. **Being politically correct gives less motivation for men to be more compassionate and women to self-reflect and look at the details**. We accept *Piaget scientific findings* of the `stages of childhood brain development`. It helped us to put children learn the correct material at appropriate ages through the school curriculum. Why can we not accept these scientific facts about the male and female brain in order to make all people optimally in their life like we do for our youth?

*Above image by AudryT showcases the focus gap of recent mags tailored between boys and girls. It apparently seems sales stack up the best when the material covered is:*

* **Girls**: Physical **concrete** appearance and tips for dealing any conflict with the best **communication** skills. (`Charismatic` with **Exhorter** Skills)   
* **Boys**: Gaining an understanding how things work (which requires a lot of **abstract** thinking) and how to become **specialized** in specific trades in a fast trending competitive world. (`Specialization` with **Contributor** Skills)

Do we want to believe our culture of this gender gap is mere a propaganda to keep the divide between the sexes? Or admit humbly the neurochemicals promoting specific cognitive styles between the different genders as the main casualty for these two distinct signatures to prevail naturally dominant within any culture? What if the issue is not only just a cultural problem but also what neurochemicals promote within our brain? Taking those two factors, how can male and female have good **communication skills** and **abstract thinking** correspondingly without putting much more effort than usual? 

For those still contested, read the epilogue `The Future of the Female Brain`. That article is so great that resonates with today's society. Today we focus so many women to focus on math and science, skills that the male sex has the edge hard wired, while the female sex does not. Instead of forcing women to learn skills that are alienated to their natural cognitive edge, we should instead focus on adding value to society (funded by startups) that focus on fields which requires skills from communication channels of the female sex, as well for the technology sector to revamp on the prescription requirements for people getting on board on those high paying salaries. The author has said that women now have the time to use 

>their female brains to create a new paradigm for the way they manage their professional, reproductive, and personal lives 

Let us instead of currently giving women **one-way streets**, to instead give **options** based on what they are passionate of and society in response adjust accordingly to that demand.

I am going to part my way today about my **Mercy** wife Heather Lee. I cannot feel a strong personality consciousness aura from her, but I know she has a strong good **taste** about things and can become **sensitive** sometimes over subtle things and anything to do with relationships. Being the elderly of all sisters, she differentiates from the rest by being tenacious and containing critical thinking in her decisions, showing a flair of **Contributor** personality. She really understands what **Contributor** personality is and tries to be a perfectionist in her works of `Graphic Design`. However, her goals are limited to **concrete** stuff instead of **abstract** stuff. I focus more on **abstract** stuff. If opposite attracts, then the best reason is due to there is every opportunity within our lifetime we can learn and compliment each other and get along with the differences of others.

The old philosopher Socrates makes a good argument about his wife as a topic of getting along with the differences of others. You can read more about it in one of [my blog posts](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2014/11/personal-selfie-1-my-current-girlfriend.html).
