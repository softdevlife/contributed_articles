##A philosophical framework: An introduction to cognitive styles

###What This Tour Is Aiming At

Welcome back to our mental map weekly module. As you know, there are several personal development guides that people follow. Most of them just talk a small part of the big picture or their full guide would have been only adequate if the world was indeed based on the philosophical idea of solipsism (that only our self only exists), leaving us the ability to have a mindset of positive thinking to the point of ignoring most of the externalizations that we do. One can take the whole idea apart and imagine it very well how that world would be by seeing how most of us treat an NPC (non-playable character) in a video game that we all know for the fact it is not real. The point is:

It does not make sense to worry what others tells us if it does not make common sense, but we should worry if we don't follow something that does not make common sense and don't do anything about it even when nobody tells us that it is important.

Why would anybody follow this principle in the first place? Think of it in the deontological ethics by Immanuel Kant. If everybody treated the world as their own turf in the same way how most people treat a sandbox in video games these days, would it really work out really well in our own end? Would we not be affected? Immanuel Kant says that for if the act of "stealing" would work out, it would only work if few people did it and the rest did not. Can you imagine if everybody stole, whether there would be any meaning to what I stole when somebody would have stolen that thing from me again? We are trying here to find a theory that fits all circumstances among all people (termed as the "categorical imperative"). When we saw the definition of "stealing" being applied to everybody, we saw that our actions were doing circles, giving no meaning or positive output as a result, not for our own self or to others. What we are trying to find here is a general principle where people can use common sense to find out with their best of their ability, through trial and error, with the help of analyzing things from multiple perspectives, a categorical imperative as the ultimate goal that can fit within our situation. That categorical imperative should have both positive results to both ourselves and to others instead of keeping us in a stall state. This is the general specific road this tour and my life is aiming for. Now do you want to live in a "video game" living out a solipsism mindset (which is much easier to do these days, given virtual reality is at the time of writing out of the corner **[1]**)? Or do you want to live in the real world where having a solipsism mindset will definitely not work out in the long term? Living in real life is where we are "heading" up to and following the categorical imperative is what the top of the roof will look like.

Is it easy to follow that principle out of the blue? How well can we figure out what is common sense or not common sense? Is there a formula to figure out what is common sense or not? I don't think we are programmed from birthright to be ruled by that principle. Other than our physical limitations, we can actually program to whatever we want to be. That can help us through trial and error to figure out by ourselves which principles don't work out well or not. We can say, "Oh this didn't work out because look how the big picture ended up to be?". Ultimately, the tour aims that, yes, we already ultimately found out so far "specific situations" which principles don't work out well or not, such as stealing. However, that is not a very smart way to tackle things because there are many specific situations that we would not be able to catch up by labeling each one whether it is right or wrong. In other words, we have to find a general principle that when used can facilitate us in a big way on how to handle any new situation filled with full of uncertainty. The greatest general principle we have created so far in tackling the objective part of the world is the scientific method. It uses some parts of our minds tackling any physical phenomena we are unfamiliar with to discover its general principles behind. Immanuel Kant gave us the general goal on what we should ultimately aim for, but it did not give us a general method on how to approach on the best way on handling the categorical imperative. What if I told you that we have something like the scientific method that can handle this problem? In fact, we were talking most of those principles in action in our previous tours. We wanted you to get a taste from several personal development books that discuss several topics about our selves, from handling tasks effectively in organizations to communicating to people effectively without any worries.

Right now all these things may be afloat to you that we have said so far and we would like to give you some heads up as some turbulence shaking from an incoming thunderstorm in our flight is coming in. I never said this trip will be a smooth ride. There are no much magic pills provided in here like other personal development tours do. Like the saying goes, "It is too good to be true". Either it won't work in the long term or we will hurt others feelings if the book does not differ from looking things from a Medieval or Darwinian or warping out our fixed mindset. Now you have to take a leap of faith in this. These three last weekend modules will be a long ride so I await those who have a leap of faith can not only withstand out of this shake up but take something out of this and apply it in our real life.

The shaking I am talking to you right now is metaphorical. As we will find out later, Perceiver mind can hold itself on facts. But those facts can be shaken up by emotional pressure. Examples. You may know your "musical recipe", but when you perform out to the audience, you get shaken up by the peer pressure of the crowd surrounding you that you end up in a stall state. Or you know that you are right on some specific topic, but when you are alone, or when people who have no clue surround you and say the opposite to what you are saying, especially if we hold those people as superior figures, that you end up backing down to what you have said, even when you have done the research properly. Haven't we done so far our research properly? "Eh..", you may reply with wonder and hesitation. Now I tell you, "When you make a decision, how much proper research you have to do before you try it out?". Most likely, your decisions are done after some days or weeks researching before you act it out. The more critical the decision (i.e. buying a house), the longer you take, but we spare some "time" to "enjoy" our decision, not buying a house before we die. In a similar way, we want you to give out a try on this theory instead of keeping it stuck hidden in the drawers with god knows how many years they were there and would it be possible for anyone to ever find it out?

We repeated so far the words "Teacher", "Mercy", "Perceiver", "Server", "Exhorter","Contributor", and "Facilitator" in our previous weekly modules often. We tried to tie it up with other books that describe the same concepts. Again and again. Do you see why we did this repetition? We did the repetition often so these words do not stand out only in one individual case. When these words can be applied to more cases, then there are high chances that this theory is solid instead of a fad. If you had a formula testing the gravity and it worked in one location, but it did not work in other location, wouldn't you be disappointed? But here you can just place it anywhere and it will always fall as we precisely predicted. Isn't that more exciting when you discover it can be applied everywhere? That is how the Perceiver mind works out as we will see later. It is looking for patterns, and the more patterns fit in the same situation, the more confident it will make the statement that "Cats have four legs". If you have never seen a cat, believe me, you wouldn't be sure if a cat had four legs because this is the first time you are watching that animal. There could be a variation like cats having five legs or six legs. In the same way, it would be absurd to say that cats have only blue eyes if that is the first time we watched a cat that has blue eyes. If we go on further, we will see that cats have green eyes or black eyes. Our Perceiver confidence helps us to make fewer chances of making mistakes. Of course, people can abuse and hijack that cognitive module. Nonetheless, unless we are high-risk takers, all things require a repetition for us to be confident on it. Given that the books provided are independent sources that I am not affiliated in any way, I think I am trying my best to not only be neutral about this theory to others, but as for me as well. I wouldn't believe this theory either if I didn't try to doubt and double-check it. So I propose you do the same as well or else you wouldn't have any faith in it.

So from now on I hope you are all prepared. For safety, please put up your seatbelts as we head inside the clouds. The seat-belts metaphorically speaking are recapping briefly to what we have learned so far in our previous weekly modules in association with the seven cognitive styles that we will discuss in depth. In the end of this tour, this material can be helpful for people harnessing their own strengths to be responsible and following a better and a more clear sense of righteousness within our world. For my own personal obsession, currently, it is to create the next social network. A lot of the features discussed in this tour will need to be translated in a way that can be adapted to our current situation of our world, in order to have better effective communications, treatment, and understanding with each other. This tour ahead will have a lot of pitfalls for many of you. It is easy to learn, but hard to master. It will be very easy to ignore the main message or use it in an improper way. This theory at this moment is currently far away from our current earthlings to be comfortable with, in the same way how rulers in the past were oblivious and ignorant about abstract algebra and science. All they could think about those times was war, but thank god we live today in a better world, not the best when many people feel empty, confused, depressed, and are full of anxiety, but at least we try to harness our world the best as we can by applying the discovered principles of math and science in order to make our life convenient. In order to be excited about this flight, due to weather conditions, we will be landing on our next weekly module in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. In the actual story, Willy Wonka gave his factory, which represents his inheritance, to a poor boy. Looking the story at an abstract way, the one that gains the inheritance of our Father is the one that "reaches" to the roof (again, you have to understand the symbolic meaning of this. How can the inheritance can "keep on going" and doesn't go bankrupt? In what "figures" we should trust to?). There are many floors in the factory full of traps. The "chocolate" in the factory, a short-term satisfaction, may entice us so much that it may get us trapped into a dead end, being oblivious of understanding the consequences behind because we didn't use our common sense. But even then, we still have to yearn for "the chocolate", for the everlasting solid joy, like Charlie Bucket did when he found the entry tickets wrapped inside a chocolate bar he bought, but only by understanding first how the chocolate factory works and not falling to its pitfalls was he able to reach the roof with Willy Wonka unlike the rest of the kids.

Understanding how our self-works is a more complicated thing because it is not a static thing like gravity, it is a thing that constantly can change by its own will, making the observation more challenging. But that is what we are aiming for, understanding how the factory of all sorts of people run under the hood. Fear not, that besides that these cognitive styles are supported in many personal development books we have gone through, as well we will go through more at our last weekly module, these cognitive styles are supported by neurological research from the authors of the theory of Mental Symmetry. There will be more instructions when we arrive at Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. For now, we will look at cognitive modules beneath the skies. Brace for impact, let me help you buckle up your seat belt by recapping what we have gone so far in this tour about cognitive modules in our next part.

**[1]** I am not trying to blame virtual reality really. It all depends on what software virtual reality will bring out. Will we be interacting with fake NPCs or will we be interacting with others? If we interact with others, will we pretend something we are not or be the same as we are in real life?

## Immanuel Kant Short Autobiography: Sapere Aude!

We talked a lot about Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative. Take a read on his life in this brief autobiography. His mantra was "Sapere Aude!" which means "Dare to know!" or "Have the courage to use your own intelligence!". We will be discussing in our next part about Contributor thought and how it uses critical thinking by bridging Perceiver (also termed as Intellectual Contributor Thought) and Server (also termed as Practical Contributor Thought): [Take A Read](https://philosophynow.org/issues/49/Sapere_Aude)

##Striving To Buckle Up

###The First Inch Of Our Journey

####Practical Contributor Thought Before, Now, After

On the first weekend module of our tour, we started our discussion on Practical Contributor thought that focuses on the PEOPLE line. As we will see later, Contributor is one of the seven cognitive styles. The book Executive Paradox talks about the Executive, the Contributor, in general. because this is a composite cognitive style and one of the most critical ones for transforming our identity, we look the Contributor in two parts:

* **Intellectual Contributor Thought**: With the emphasis on Perceiver mode. This is the abstract realm, the TASKS line, where a Contributor sets a plan or strategy after analyzing the situation. You can say a plan is a theory. You can say analysis as making associations to support a plan, such as citing multiple sources when writing a research paper. Respectively, we see in Executive Paradox the analytical mode as RATIONAL and the theoretical mode as VISIONARY. Those two have a place as cognitive styles: Perceiver and Teacher respectively. This is a great place to take control of your TIME, such as placing a goal you want to achieve in 10 or 20 years ahead. This is mostly where academic science focuses, looking at the word objectively.
* **Practical Contributor Thought**: With an emphasis on Server mode. It focuses on the present time. Most importantly, how to set a plan from Intellectual Contributor Thought into action. The action cognitive module represents the COMMANDING mode in Executive Paradox. In our representation, it will be termed as the Server cognitive style. The Server may sound like a very simple straightforward cognitive module, very much mechanical in a way, but it is indeed one of the hardest to master, especially if your new goals set apart from your current goals you were doing all along. Think for instance how much of the most radical goals you set have been achieved when you placed them as your new year resolution. In many cases, we use that cognitive style in a wrong way by the influences of what is EMPOWERING to us, another mode of the Executive Paradox. This represents as the Mercy cognitive module. This is actually the core, the place where we live and represent. Talking about a theory does not bother us, but how much it will bother us if it has to be applied to our self? That is why being COMMANDING takes its toll, not for its actions itself, but how it will affect us personally and whether we can tolerate it, in the same way as research influences a theory in different dimensions. This represents how business operations operate, how to move within SPACE certain variables from one destination to another. Moving those variables are easy if we fulfill existing beliefs of our identity. It is quite the opposite when our existing beliefs become a bottleneck on taking the courage for setting a different set of actions that contradict on what we previously did. Effort and discipline are important pillars for making that change achievable.

Practical Contributor Thought may have lost the light of the day a long time ago, as Modern Man by I.M. Panagiotopoulos discusses. The book was written at the time of the 1980s where the traditions of existing religions were taken away and dismantled. It was more like a rebellion in all sorts of forms. It was at that time where the new age of spirituality took form and allowed any person to be anything he wanted to be. There are two takes from that event:

* **The positive - No more blind faith**: One of the problems with the practices of past religion is that it took those good will examples of the scripture at a face token value. Given Piaget Childhood Development tells us that children critical thinking is not fully developed enough, examples are indeed appropriate for children that do not know what is right or wrong. However, our goal is to be adults, not children with a childish mindset. Religion focus wasn't much on using our critical thinking, a general prescription, on how to handle more complicated issues in a practical way. Science found its own general prescription on making discoveries of the physical world with the Scientific Method that was practical. It was so successful that the industrial and technological revolution took over the whole economy, creating a partial illustration of what heaven looks like in our external physical world. An example of good will (i.e. no murdering, no stealing, etc.) are to an extent useful to understand what a theory is all about, otherwise, it is hard to grasp the formula. The scriptures discuss the formula of how to be a righteous man relentlessly, but the main cause of the new age rebellion was due to the existing faithful only following in examples and anything else more general to follow practically as unprofound to be applied in our current world.
* **The negative - The rebels with no example - Nihilism**: What always occurs in history is when an idea within a plan has no element of action into it, people will ultimately create another plan with action on it, ultimately not being the best plan. Most of the rebels on the new age indeed created formulas for making their life better but left the examples of the old faithful out of the equation. Even when most didn't understand the true colors of the scriptures at those times, there was a general prescription or formula at that time, to put those examples in the equation, such as the categorical imperative by Immanuel Kant. However, that requires effort and discipline in the same format educating ourselves in school does not relieve us immediately on its benefits until a later time. Couple with the rebels rebelling on education and the old faithful negligent on pushing the boundaries of being more practical while ignoring the context of the current situation, slim where the possibilities to overcome.

Conclusively, people were empowering for their own self and not for others. The replacement of the old faithful with the new age may have lead things even worse than people who blindly followed some good will examples. However, since the new age were more open minded, they should have reached the opportunity to self-reflect whether the actions they do should have a general prescription where all people have an open space of adding value instead of only for themselves.

The end result of the new age is what I.M. Panagiotopoulos generally discusses: People who use empowering words to others are used in a cheap way, as they only cater for themselves and not for others. The word "good morning" (Kalimera) has become cheap, losing its original meaning that was intended. The result of that is what we are ultimately empowered of, we haven't thought of it twice, we act as heroes when we are actually not. In order to be empowering as heroes are, we should try to master instead of begging down on what we should actually be empowering of. That requires great courage that needs to grow first before it can take out of our hearts. But people these days don't use Intellectual Contributor Thought much (which is needed to grow our courage) because their plan is so simple that only caters for themselves. That is no much different than how most of us treat video games through a solipsism mindset. Life is too complicated that we want to imagine it being simple to keep our self in a comfort zone. It is the easiest for the mind to follow through with its least effort on understanding things, making biases, setting a plan in motion that ignores all the externalizations that come from it. This mindset at least uses some form of combination that can bridge Intellectual Contributor Thought with Practical Contributor Thought. Yay for progress on critical thinking. Nay for the selfish mindset that it is incarnated within. This is what basically Anthony Robbins is mainly preaching, a successful critical thinking mindset. In contrast, I propose a more mindful and challenging task for a Contributor to face off. A mindset that is based on Ideal critical thinking. Otherwise, the output of our conversation with others will be a cheap dialogue with others, such as the one I.M. Panagiotopoulos discusses. The dead ends of capturing the true colors of theology will be a topic of our next weekly module. Besides a theology that lacks the use of critical thinking, we propose that a mindset that uses critical thinking only successfully and not ideally will make our world less work out as a result, as it does not follow the principles of the categorical imperative.

I have conclusively found out that the Perceiver is good at holding some values. However, they become an obstacle if the decisions that are to be made do not require much planning and can be experimented multiple times. However, a Perceiver mindset, that helps Intellectual Contributor Thought, on choices where you can only do once in a lifetime, as we have only one life, and not multiple lives to try this again, may save us on avoiding a mid-life crisis or turn ourselves to a dead end. That is the main reason that although this repetition and discussion about cognitive styles and Mental Symmetry may be tiring for you or me, my blog and this tour discusses a mental map for anyone who wants to dive deep to the core message of transforming ourselves into people who strive their critical thinking for the ideal. I am providing a template of Intellectual Contributor Thought that takes a personal cost to fill it out in order to be more prepared on facing an identity that looks things more ideally.

So in summary:

Contributor uses Intellectual and Practical Contributor Thought.
* **Before**: Religion used to focus on Intellectual Contributor Thought, but it did not bridge to be practical, resulting into a blind faith mindset.
* **Now**: New age brought critical thinking to the table, bridging Intellectual and Practical thought, but in a very simplified way, thinking only what is successful to us instead of the ideal.
* **After**: Artificial intelligence is around the corner making decisions. A lot of articles prefer for AI to be more ideal than the decisions people make out from their own impulses. Will the AI model strive to the ideal? And if it becomes possible, why will people fear it? For if people want to be competitive, they will eventually need to apply it to themselves as well and they won't be prepared for it.

###The Second Inch: The different ways of strapping it in

Before moving our first inch, we didn't know how to define ethics. There are people that define ethics as evolutionary where the abstractions cannot be defined. It is very funny if that was applied to the scientific method literally. We would then go and discard a formula that gives us 99% accuracy because events cannot be defined by a general formula, a general abstraction. On the other hand, there are people who think certain principles should be optional, violating Immanuel Kant categorical imperative. An institution may still hold to its ground even if some people mess it up, but if everybody messes it up, it won't be able to keep up, ultimately begging down to its own knees. Lastly, there are people who think ethics as following certain examples. Maybe those examples worked in a certain situation, certain use case. But a person will not follow ethics to the fullest without knowing how to "generate" good will examples. Not any person can master that skill first without knowing a general way of following a good will. And this tour tries to aim at describing as much as we have so far "discovered" (like a scientist would say also) this universal principle. We didn't describe in detail and explicitly the process, but as we have gone through a series of weekly modules within our tour, you would have intuitively received a partial illustration implicitly of what it would look like. Apparently, this will not be a mystery recipe, yet not one that we can easily digest, as personal growth always starts with a sour taste after all. For this weekly module, we will be expressing in more solid form the mechanisms behind those seven cognitive styles in a philosophical perspective. In our next weekly module, we will tie them all together through a theological perspective.

In summary, there are five mindsets a person can focus:

* **1 - Frozen**: This is not only an individual who has never used or given up on critical thinking (which uses Contributor Thought) but also shows an absence of meeting the existing habitual needs that emerge (The Mental Networks in Mercy Thought). Interesting enough, the mind in that model has no pressure to defend itself, making it vulnerable to compliance. There is definitely no obsessions driven to achieve, there is no much character or individualism within. Avoid this mode if you ever can. Living like that is a lost cause. My blog and this tour are full of purpose, which is the opposite of what a frozen mindset stands.
* **2 - Habitual**: This is a person who lacks critical thinking and follows a set of pieces that were provided by third party vendors and just installs them in his mind. Some pieces are good, some pieces are bad. Most habits that we do are ultimately useless, a noise that covers the background of our real goal of creating our own pieces by the use of our critical thinking. In those instances, our executive voice, our Contributor mindset, is usually absent. If our core of our life is to focus living habitually, we will find sooner or later that it is not possible to keep up without finding and understanding meaningful value, adding value by innovation, as well keeping up with changing circumstances. Being honest with myself, a lot of my childhood time was spent off living habitually. Although I absorbed content from multiple sources, whether that was from school or video games because that was the norm to educate or entertain yourself correspondingly, there were great starting blocks to understand the current situation of our world, but it requires an extra step to comprehend it more clearly, as well if someone brave enough wants to do something more about it. That extra step is critical thinking.

If people use critical thinking, then it will be very easy to discover what obsession is encapsulated within themselves. Of course, people who believe a life should be driven Habitually will enforce others obnoxiously that they are disillusioned, that they should live Habitually as well. On the other hand, a person who uses critical thinking expects others to convert their habitual mindset to a one with critical thinking. But there are more conflicts between people among those mindsets. For instance, we mentioned previously that critical thinking can be split into two parts: Intellectual and Practical Contributor Thought. There are Intellectuals (strategists) who fight against people who do things with little thought (practicals). People who serve the world (practicals) can't stand with people who procrastinate and do little to no application to their ideologies in real life (intellectuals). And last but not least, the best of all strategies, is a balanced Contributor mindset, which will not challenge other peoples' mindset as inferior or as a dead end, but instead help others' people deficiencies (whether it is frozen, habitual, or a partial illustration of Contributor thought), to create solutions to those existing problematic mindsets and coach them for that cause instead of treating the rest of the mindsets with blame or by aggravating the problem. Let us look at those three contributor styles:

* **3 - Intellectual Contributor Thought**: We discussed previously what Intellectual Contributor Thought does. But let us also indicate how this thought can also be used impartially. When we don't focus being Rational, our hypothesis can be narrow-minded, to the point we don't think of the general picture. Some people use this mode in a very subtle way, generate a theory, throw it out, and ignore how narrow-minded that theory turns out to be. This is a teacher strategy of a childish mindset overgeneralization, such as "(You always)/(All people) are X". On the other hand, being too detail oriented can make us more collective, but too much collective, can lead us to be more anxious than we suppose too, creating a plan that takes one to two weeks to months or even years with who knows if it will ever come to the surface for fear our idea is not perfect enough. That overprotective mindset can be found in a Perceiver mindset. Let me reassure you that a person who focuses on Intellectual Contributor Thought never abuses being subtle to it as "he lives in it", yet doesn't give much a second thought about a plan that he has made, that when circumstances arrive, he will not doubt much the choice it has to make. Ultimately, although the choices on the specific domain of an Intellectual Contributor person is obsessed of can carry some risk of picking the wrong choice, high odds is that they are not, and ultimately they cancel out of all the choices that he has done in that specific domain. The problem of an Intellectual Contributor is his procrastination to dealing those issues with the here and now, that only when circumstances get ugly, he will attempt to apply it in life. In other words, he lacks the essence and motivation of Practical Contributor Thought. It will not try to stand out from the rest of the crowd even when others stand out before him with ideas that are second to none of what an Intellectual Contributor contains. Ultimately and ironically, it is the Practical Contributors that add the most value to the table, that although their ideas can be inferior, they are at least the only ones moving the boulder of our world with their own two hands. Over the last few years, I got accustomed to being very comfortable acting as an Intellectual Contributor, as it uses Perceiver mode. What I found important was that there are some principles in human behavior. Of course, those studies are found in psychology, statistics, neurology, even data science and artificial intelligence these days. However, I am pretty sure nobody has set the record straight in here whether gravity should go upward or downward, leaving that uncertainty for anyone to avoid studying this as part of our own personal development curriculum. We are trying to break the streak of this unwinding belief that human behavior cannot be comprehended. And like it is impossible for people to work "properly" without having a basic education understanding abstract principles of how our objective world works, so I do not believe people can even grasp or to even believe them they can make a society a better place without first having some form of experience like an education curriculum provides that requires a lot of effort and time aside that you have to learn yourself at a personal cost. So it does ring a bell that Intellectual Contributor Thought should go first before Practical Contributor Thought, in the same way, we educate first before we take a working role in society.
* **4 - Practical Contributor Thought**: Practical Contributor Thought can remind us how a belief can manifest us in tremendous ways in how we perceive our life and how it affects the rest of the world. Given that Practical Contributor Thought is all about action or Server mode, one can really tell apart a religion or tribe that focuses specifically on placing action more than words: Jews. Of those, there are some group of people who believe of the Ein Sof, which literally means using Intellectual Contributor Thought in the most subtle way possible. However, there is another group of people who are more open-minded about the purpose of life, that is, the belief that no mainstream visible group has found or discovered yet the real meaning of life, yet it is possible to be found in the here and now. If you reached so far here, most of the pieces of what makes our life and its purpose of it are already presented to you, and you will have the choice, later on, to contemplate and decide whether to make out of it or not for being driven to it by our identity or not. There are others who are very good at doing stuff but have no purpose or are completely lost on creating some goals about their life. This is evidently seen in Server mode. There are people who definitely use Practical Contributor thought to serve themselves and what is familiar that may satisfy for the short term, but not for the long term. This is the default way a Mercy strategy would deal things. In contrast, a Practical Contributor Thought does not get bogged down to the familiar and takes risks on unfamiliar territory, yet it knows the limits of when it crosses the line or not. One of the things with Practical Contributors is they do much, too much, that they would have been more productive if they reflected themselves where they were heading at least once in a while. Maybe the direction they chose has a lot of dead ends of what they have hoped for or they haven't looked other perspectives of dealing the same things in life in order to be more productive that would take little to no effort. Maybe that small vacation or having to shift themselves to a different environment makes some Practical Contributors become enlightened again. But in order for that to work consistently, they have to put a habit to themselves to self-reflect themselves, to use Intellectual Contributor Thought.
* **5 - All-Star Contributor**: When a Contributor integrates Intellectual and Practical Contributor thought, such an individual is almost impenetrable. We hope that whatever he is doing is for a good cause, and because that is not guaranteed, that is the main reason, that besides philosophy, we need theology to come hand to hand. When we discuss Contributor, we will be talking about the All-Star Contributor. That individual executes goals that have low risks of failing out. It does not only set goals but executes them as well. Those goals are not shady but well prepared that contain the least risk of something unexpected to happen. This is the combination of what a Contributor is, a mix of Perceiver and Server Mode.

It is hard to keep up how all those seven cognitive styles behave: what they have access of and what do they influence of. We discussed the Contributor thought in detail in our first two inches of our journey on attempting to buckle ourselves up. The Perceiver Mode has access to Mercy mode and influences Teacher Mode. The Server Mode has access of Teacher mode and influences Mercy mode. It is more like an interchange between the two modes. If Perceiver creates a grand plan, Server cognitive style responds to it because it has access to it (Teacher), influencing our Mercy identity. Contributor has access to Perceiver and Server mode and influences Facilitator mode. But before Contributor is able to run its own engine, it needs to be influenced by Exhorter Strategy. What is Exhorter? What is Facilitator? We will go in those two modes in our last part of buckling ourselves up: Finding the connectors to bundle up and tightening the grip for a smooth ride. Then we will wrap up this weekend module summarizing all the cognitive styles which include the four simple cognitive styles: Perceiver, Server, Mercy Teacher. Why did we talk about Contributor style first? Because that is the main component of the car, it is the main engine. If you have seen a car for the first time, would you care about what is under the hood or whether to have a feeling what is its main functionality? We come to the conclusion that the mind core purpose is the Contributor strategy to be up and running. However, there are two other auxiliary cognitive styles that support making the car be mobile while having a smooth experience. We will see that the Exhorter represent the tires of the car which makes the car the ability to explore and discover, while the Facilitator tries to make the Contributor decisions smooth experiences, more like the car's transistor that helps you change shifts. But before we explore those two modes, take a read on my first draft I wrote some time ago about the visibility of each cognitive style. This is important as it is kind of cruel to treat other people obnoxiously on something that they have less or no access to, as well to use our cognitive styles that drive the car only in concrete terms.

###Finding the connectors to bundle up and tightening the grip for a smooth ride

We discussed previously the different ways of strapping it in and conclusively found in the end that there is only one effective way to strap it in: The "All-Star Contributor". It has the perfect combination of both looking things abstractly and concretely at the same time. Take note of the words abstract (Intellectual Contributor) and concrete (Practical Contributor) carefully. We will have some more terminology that we have to go along the way. One of the things a Contributor dislikes is uncertainty with high risks. It wants to have control of the situation, to not let those dreams go astray the next day he wakes up. Briefly, there are two uncertainties:

* **Fuzzy logic**: Contributor works with Boolean Logic, not with fuzzy logic. Although a Perceiver works logic in a fuzzy way, it ultimately tries to reach to some boolean logic. But what is important is that before we reach to something boolean, we always start with something fuzzy. This can be elaborated by the characteristic of a Perceiver Mind (And also the Mercy Mind it has access to) to work in an Associative way. When we learn a new word or a new procedure, we usually always try to decipher the "meaning" by associating with other things. For example, "So this X is like between A and B?", "Building X is two blocks right to A and 5 blocks up from C".
* **Sloppiness**: In order to have a plan to work out, we have to think of the order of things like when we cook something from a recipe. All goes smooth if we follow the instructions in the correct order, do them randomly, and most likely what you will get out is something not edible. In the same way, deciding the order of things on how to do something, from simple tasks like writing a sentence to executing a strategy, they all seem to matter of getting the sequence right. We live in a world where our identity is expressed through a sequence of concrete action. The first tries, you won't get exactly to the ideal way of doing things. It will not be in the correct order. It takes multiple tries before a sloppy work becomes to the expected order of what we originally intended. This is where being analytical in the context of our previous sequences matter in order to get things right the next time we try. Server works (And also the Teacher Mind it has access to) in an analytical way.

But who wants Sloppiness? Who wants Fuzzy Logic? Those are essentially the starting point on untangling unknown variables. They help us make those unknown variables become more solid, more clear, in the same way when we play a game of hangman. We discussed that Contributor prefers something that is already solid in the first place before committing into it. How can he reach there if he doesn't play the game of hangman in the first place? That cognitive style doesn't interact much on the unknown as much as the Exhorter Strategy does. Exhorter strategy is the one that hits the rubber to the road over a fuzzy logic in a sloppy way with many trial and errors until it gets it right. An Exhorter loves grasping theories but without going too deep into them. He wants to try them out immediately. He does not mind trying something out that was never tried out before. Those ultimately yield high risk. Those principles are the ones that violate Intellectual Contributor Thought and Practical Contributor Thought that follow a goal perfectly, yet we need to follow this pathway first in order to discover unknown variables, to explore new terrains. Ultimately, we all start exploring stuff through discovery (using Exhorter mode) before we focus on some specific specialization (using Contributor mode). Sometimes our specialization is too limited that we need to take new approaches by taking a step back and discovering things. Now let us bring another terminology to the table: Emotions and Confidence. Exhorter has access to the Emotion modules: Teacher and Mercy. What an Exhorter is good at is playing up with emotions, it is what drives him to be excited with. The riskier it is, the more emotional it is, the more it becomes driven to give it a try. It is more like bringing Mr. Excitement to the table for our executive voice to take on the courage on taking some action. Of course, there are some problematic ways where an Exhorter can't distinct something risky to completely dangerous, being addicted to the adrenaline to it, but that is another story to discuss it. In contrast, a Contributor serves the Confident modules: Perceiver and Server. When there is enough layer of Confidence on the Contributor, he picks from the available choices Mr. Excitement bring, sets closure by picking out the best one, and works on that goal until the end of it. In contrast, an Exhorter strategy prefers on starting things out instead of maintaining them.

Another way to think of Exhorter strategy and Contributor strategy is normal thought and technical thought correspondingly.

>Normal thought involves the cooperation of all seven cognitive modules. It provides the framework that ties together mental networks, and it provides a semi-rigorous starting point for the rigorous thinking of technical thought. (Natural Cognitive Theology)

This can also be thought as revolutionary science in Thomas Kuhn Scientific Revolutions. Also, termed as innovation in Black Box Thinking:

>Rather, they make judicious use of tests, challenge their own assumptions, and wield the lessons to guide strategy. It is a mix of top-down reasoning (as per the mathematicians) and bottom-up iteration (as per the biologists); the fusing of the knowledge they already have with the knowledge that can be gained by revealing its inevitable flaws. It is about having the courage of one’s convictions, but also the humility to test early, and to adapt rapidly (Black Box Thinking)

In contrast, Contributor Strategy focuses on optimization on a specific domain by the use of Technical Thought:

>Technical thought, in contrast, emerges when Contributor thought restricts mental processing. Because technical thinking applies rigorous thought within a limited context, it brings improvements to specific areas. (Natural Cognitive Theology)

This can also be thought as normal science in Thomas Kuhn Scientific Revolutions. Also termed as "Marginal Gains" In Black Box Thinking:

>The approach comes from the idea that if you break down a big goal into small parts, and then improve on each of them, you will deliver a huge increase when you put them all together. (Black Box Thinking)

Once we discover where exactly the connectors are and tuck our seatbelt in, we have to tighten the grip for avoiding any rumbles ahead of our journey. That is where the Facilitator strategy comes in. This strategy is the one that can make the most acquaintances with most people as it has access to all cognitive styles. It also analyzes the current situation of things. Sometimes a Contributor strategy may not have thought the consequences of placing a plan to the main road. It may not be taken lightly as he may not have read the general current situation. That is why a Facilitator strategy adjusts the plan while keeping the same core message in order for the plan to go more smooth.

Alright! We are all set! Let us wrap this up by looking the interplay of Emotions and Confidence in one of my first draft articles. [Take a read](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-interplay-of-emotions-and.html)

####Exhorter Strategy: How Innovation Works

Without a prototype that is not very detailed by an Exhorter strategy, we cannot ever progress our journey of our ultimate destination. Dyson, the dual-cyclone vacuum cleaner came to fruition not by the Technical thought of his existing previous workplace rejecting his idea, but by his own courage and effort, by writing up more than five thousand prototypes before achieving on making the perfect vacuum cleaner.[Take a read](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/please-more-brainstorm-sessions-how-innovation-really-matthew-syed)

###An Introduction To Cognitive Styles

![mentalsymmetry](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12673581/22601357/76bb8a2e-ea79-11e6-8322-d9c84cd7275f.jpg)

We did discuss Cognitive Styles on our previous weekly modules. In Weekly Module 3, we learned the Contributor style from the lenses of the book Executive Paradox by David G. Jensen. In Weekly Module 4, we learned to balance the elements of a Contributor Style in order to meet people demands while maintaining things in order. We also understand from Weekly Module 6 that words, which represent an abstract form, are important, yet it is hard to bring that topic to the table, as with how most of us deal our Visual Communication in concrete terms as seen in Weekly Module 8. Conclusively, most people first and full priority on their list is to take all things in concrete terms. This has led to the stereotype of the male gender being an alpha aggressive do achiever (Server mindset) while the Female gender as the sensitive with empathy (Mercy mindset). Sensitivity is an important topic if we want to deal changing our identity and that goes with no questions that it requires a different set of actions to change on who we are while also having the courage to step in the uncertain high risk whether others will accept us or pressure us into something we were not used to be. In Weekly Module 5, we discussed the Female Brain by Louann Brizendine. We see differences between the Male and Female Brain in terms by default how the brain circulates chemicals and how it allocates a different amount of space for the same regions. We have seen that both male and female brain thinks in abstract ways, just use different circuits. Conclusively, we wrapped up that Weekly Module by stating that a Female Brain emphasizes Exhorter Mode (which is a combination of Teacher And Mercy) while a Male Brain emphasizes Contributor Mode (which is a combination of Perceiver and Server).

So what is a cognitive style? What is a style? We know what a style is. But how does that represent cognitively? Well if a house is messed up or tidy, we can easily tell, right? In the same way, if a person feels up or down, we can also tell by their appearance of their clothes, if they are willing to express themselves, right? Apparently, that seems to be so. However, there are exceptions to this rule of people expressing themselves concretely in clothes. First, people must be willing to care about the here and now enough in order to reflect their identity with the clothes they wear. Secondly, some people are indifferent, such as being frozen (which we discussed previously). However, each person has a different version of expressing themselves up or down. In that sense, each person has a different style to express themselves. Some people like to wear bold clothes. Others want to wear clothes that literally "pop-up". Others prefer to wear elegant clothes while others prefer to wear simple clothes. In the same way, each person picks one of the cognitive styles we mentioned before and expresses all their experiences through those lenses.

Now let us look at Cognitive Styles from a deeper perspective. Do you see how Male and Female Brain try to emphasize certain regions of the brain, especially on childhood development? We will call these regions that make us emphasize as our main priority, the thing that dominates us, as our consciousness, while anything else that we take as lower priority as subconsciousness. The reason subconsciousness was a very hard thing to be defined is because, for each person, their subconsciousness can be different, what we treat something as subconscious, for others it can be their main consciousness. The other thing that we have to look for is the personality of each person. We take the assumption that a person will usually focus on one specific cognitive style as their main consciousness. There is undoubtedly no questioning that a person has a specific character. Two people with the same cognitive style can be completely different not only on how they treat their main consciousness but how they treat the other cognitive styles that are run subconsciously. A great metaphor the original site used to discuss cognitive styles is thinking about the brain as your house, each cognitive style as a room, the one you are conscious as your main room, and the rest subconscious styles as facilitating rooms to keep you up for the rest of the day, such as showering in the bathroom and eating your breakfast in your kitchen. All in sum what matters ultimately is how you keep your whole house tidy instead of only your main room while placing barricades all over the place. So let me re-iterate as this is important: Aside what your cognitive style is, what is important and is easy for me or others to grasp or care more from you is how you take in charge and taking care the rest of the cognitive styles in your brain. Especially if we lack critical thinking, our cognitive style may not be functioning, it may have been overridden by third-party components, such as entertainment, culture and family upbringing, letting its main consciousness being all time asleep. I think the house metaphor can go many ways, so I leave that up to your imagination. Let us wrap up this weekly module by learning the main highlights of the seven cognitive styles:

1 - [Teacher](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/teacher.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: None
<br>**Composition**: Analytical, Abstract, Emotion
<br>**Type**: Simple
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style is usually one of the rarest ones to appear in human form. They are definitely very absorbed to the abstract world. More specifically to theories. Theories represent Teacher Mental Networks. A Teacher can ignore the slice of life to focus on intellectual work any time of the day. If education was boring, for a healthy Teacher it may be not. They take theories more proactively than the rest of the cognitive styles. They take theories at a very deep emotional level. It is not hard to imagine that their background of their mind could be bombarded full of academic theoretical scientific thought. Education main goal is for individuals to learn abstract stuff about the objective world in order to become more productive and bring more original ideas to the table. We will find that educating about our own self is important in order to improve our self as well become more valuable members of society. Despite this is not a very common cognitive style, it is the most important cognitive style to master, as we will see later on.

2 - [Mercy](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/mercy.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: None
<br>**Composition**: Associative, Concrete, Emotion
<br>**Type**: Simple
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style is the place where our identity resides. In contrast with the Teacher, a Mercy person originality relies on focusing on the concrete slice of life of here and now. Although cleanliness and tidiness are aspects any concrete mindset will focus, a Mercy person usually puts the most effort. All of us start with this cognitive style in our childhood. It is the first to form and live in as part of our mental development. Knowing how children behave, this is one of the easiest cognitive styles to understand. That is one of the main reason why Mercy people can mutually relate the best when nurturing a child. An elementary school teacher becomes also a popular destination career choice. A Mercy can easy associate events as good or bad ones by past experiences or memories that have some relativity or similarity. In other words, they have to bear with their sensitivity. Since this sensitivity of Mercy Mental Networks takes an emotional toll, many people call it as Heart. The Mercy by default reacts based on recent individualized events while avoiding any trigger that will result as an inconsistent input to the mercy mental networks that it holds. It uses etiquette to avoid bad experiences and sincerity from others for having a genuine sense that positive experiences are guaranteed to come ahead.

3 - [Server](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/server.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: Teacher
<br>**Composition**: Analytical, Concrete, Confidence
<br>**Type**: Simple
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style is the place where our action serves our current mental networks (which represent the familiar and known) or use our understanding (Teacher) to move our identity to a better place. A Server is a usually emotional stable person, especially when situations of his environment don't need to change much. The typical job that requires more activity while keeping your emotions stable can be found in a typical nurse role. It is one of the most simple styles, as it loves to try things out by doing it literally with his physical hands (or something that abstractly mimics that). Good at mastering skills. However, the Server can get lost when having to face new situations that are unfamiliar with him, as he has no much a sophisticated internal map or setting strategy goals for the next five or ten years ahead. In other words, a Server prefers to complete tasks by not re-inventing the wheel while leaving ventures on new trails as a last resort. In order to be more complete, it needs to fill it up with someone who can complete the understanding. Thus, it is common to pair with a simple or composite style that contains the Teacher Cognitive style.

4 - [Perceiver](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/perceiver.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: Mercy
<br>**Composition**: Associative, Abstract, Confidence
<br>**Type**: Simple
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style is the starting point of refining abstract thought. A theory needs some starting building blocks, but in order to verify and keep a building stable, we need to inspect by our own rational thought. Many call this term as foundations or principles. In contrast to the Mercy, a Perceiver collects individual instances and places them into a category, making each category to be in shades of black and white instead of the typical black or white. Given a Perceiver collects patterns, it is good at finding inconsistencies. If a Perceiver cultivates interdisciplinary knowledge, he can transfer with his association skills solutions from one field of discipline to another. A Perceiver person has a hard time coping up with hypocrisy, negligence, and no effort on pushing foundations forward. Sometimes, this becomes ironic, as the Perceiver who hates those stuff becomes a hypocrite to himself because he does not act on them. The reason behind this is because a Perceiver has access to the Mercy mind, having awareness of its sensitivities. It finds it hard how to make justice at the emotional toll of dealing the sensitivities of our identity. For that reason, a Perceiver usually pairs up with a Mercy person in order to look more deep at the problem.

5 - [Exhorter](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/exhorter.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: Teacher, Mercy
<br>**Composition**: Hybrid
<br>**Type**: Composite
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style is your average salesman. I like the pun of the original site portraying the Exhorter as accomplishing the outrageous impossible: Forget about selling pens! "He can sell a refrigerator to an Eskimo". Prodding, encouraging, taking risks, are all the essential characteristics of an Exhorter Person. Sometimes his exaggeration can turn an Eskimo a reason to have a refrigerator collection. It is very good at handling moments of crisis: When time almost runs out, your best value is getting something out that at least works. When something doesn't work out or fails, he will find other routes to get to his destination. An Exhorter usually likes more on working on new things rather than maintaining them as the novelty of the project diminishes over time. There are some disadvantages to that. Some people expect exaggerations as actual promises. Some people dislike when people stop things in the middle when less novelty is involved. Unlike the Exhorter that hangs on the excitement, people hang on something solid, that when the expected input is under the threshold or becomes absent, mental networks will signal emotional pain. In order for an Exhorter to be more complete, he needs to know when he crosses the line of not being responsible and coping up with the accountability.

6 - [Contributor](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/contributor.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: Server, Perceiver
<br>**Composition**: Hybrid
<br>**Type**: Composite
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style builds up by what the Exhorter has brought to the table. Unlike the Exhorter which tries several paths until he finds a goldmine, a Contributor locks into the one that brings the best value and tries to finish it until the very end. His plans are carefully examined by looking how each road will look years ahead, minimizing the risks or the potential to lose. His ability to focus helps him to keep the persistence and endurance on completing the chosen specific road while ignoring all the other choices. On the flip-side, it needs to find the correct timing for leaving the Exhorter strategy on finding more opportunities, as well giving some space to others for finding the best possible way of traversing that route. Although finding a journey may be a difficult task, reaching the destination is the most challenging task. To keep the balances in check, it usually pairs up with an Exhorter.

7 - [Facilitator](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/facilitator.php)
<br>**Visibility Of Subconscious Modes**: All
<br>**Composition**: Hybrid
<br>**Type**: Composite
<br>**Description**: This cognitive style tries to make the most acquaintances as possible, even with people who dislikes or are even mean-spirited to him. It builds up what the Contributor has brought to the table and tries to adapt by changing the context while keeping the main message across. A role that fits a Facilitator style may be that of a Psychologist, as it needs to face all sorts of people and needs to adapt to each cognitive style preferences. A Facilitator can be truly helpful in many ways. Given they can have many acquaintances, they create amicable relationships and coordination with others. Etiquette and manners are a polite way for others to do something and it is no wonder a Facilitator doesn't understand why others aren't too polite and obnoxious to others in order things getting done. However, although a Facilitator may be good at running things, it may not put enough attention by diving deep into the details, as it is not one of the cognitive styles that have the best focus after all. Sometimes the changes a Facilitator does are only to keep things stable instead of understanding what is actually happening under the hood. A mature Facilitator will instead not be afraid of making small multiple experiments on the existing black box Contributor provides in order to really understand what is under the hood so it can add meaningful lasting changes.

For more information about the cognitive styles, I really strongly recommend reading the book [All Sorts of People: Ordered Complexity by Lane Friesen](http://a.co/2yuuFCx) which discusses in detail the origin of the research (by looking at autobiographies) and describing the details of each cognitive module. Alternatively, a lot of the same material is [accessible on the old website (archived)](http://web.archive.org/web/20060502061406/http://209.87.142.42/y/p/orient.htm)

**Conclusion**

And we are done for this weekend module. But if you haven't noticed, our plane cannot keep up with the turbulence because our body is not ready yet to what is ahead of us. We need to take a recap study on what theology is all about before we can use these tools at great lengths. We have to take a parachute after all and land to that big island where the chocolate factory resides. Don't worry, this will not take too long as much as how long it took us before jamming those seat belts until we snapped them in. We just need to wrap just one more aftermath post as we wind down in the whirlpool of thousand feet of air bellow where it resides our next weekly module: normal pain vs hyper pain.

###Aftermath: Normal Pain Vs. Hyper Pain

In Week 7, we discussed Teacher Mental Networks and Mercy Mental Networks. Mental networks expect a general consistent input. If the input is not satisfactory or not met in regular intervals, normal pain interrupts the brain as a signal. However, it is usually the withdrawal symptoms, the interval period where our mental networks are in the last stages of breaking apart, that become the most painful to bear with. We call that pain as hyper pain. If we want to move from a set of actions that are different than the set of actions we currently do, there will eventually be a hyper pain of leaving our current set of actions not only for ourselves but as well affecting any dependencies those set of actions have relied upon other people. One of the main topics in our next weekly module is about transforming our self. That requires replacing existing mental networks with better ones. That requires having the courage to deal with hyper pain. The simplest use case in dealing the process of hyper pain is when we see someone dear that has passed away. The person who passes away does not exist anymore physically in the world, so there is no way to comfort the mental networks on any consistent input that this person exists in some way where we can talk to him. Eventually, the individual is able to cope with the hyper pain. This event has been analyzed enough that we have a process called the 5 stages of grief. Take a read in one of my first drafts explaining the different pains a person encounters, including the mental networks which we discussed just now.[Take a read](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2014/08/types-of-pain-part-1.html)

#### Solace And The Five Stages Of Grief

Solace, a game that was shown in 2011 Independent Games Festival, is a short shoot em up game that instead of invading aliens or colonies, you fight against your own grief. The game has five levels and the name of the five levels come after the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. Although I mentioned this game in my blog post "Types Of Pain", I dedicate another post for more awareness about the game. If you have some free time and a basic know-how on playing shoot em up games, it is a worthwhile investment installing the game and giving it a go, as the main experience of the game is its moving story as you pass through the different stages of grief.

### Did You Know? How Birth Order Affects Personality

The Huffington post article by Dr. Gail Gross discusses how birth order can be a factor in building up some of our subconscious (or conscious) cognitive styles. More specifically:

* The eldest one learns the Contributor Style (The Achiever)
* The middle in the family learns the Facilitator Style (The Peacemaker)
* The last in the family learns the Exhorter Style (The Life Of The Party)

### Did You Know? Exhorter Drives For Hope. Depression And Parkinson Disease.

 Joining this journey, let us keep a reminder that as long as our ideas bring positive effects to the world, our deepest aspirations are the things that we should hold if we want to hold personally ourselves in the end. Exhorter strategy focuses on that vision with hope. That hope enables it to try to find different ways of attempting to get closer to the destination. People who give up on what drives them to the core, that is, they don't "do" what they "think" deep within their heart, then whatever they substitute to may not be enough, leading them to chronic depression. Research shows that how we operate our mindset can take control over our body in negative ways, such as mental diseases like Parkinson's Disease.

Meet the case of John's sister, a mature student that gained an advanced degree in linguistics. An individual that had a sense of responsibility, but had absolutely no idea what to do about it. An individual where it chose intellectual pursuits that remained separate from the actions that were demanded by her heart. The result was Parkinson's disease, a brilliant individual mentally, but increasing disabled physically. [Take a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngfpBRqwDY)
