In Executive Paradox by David G. Jensen, we learn to `stretch`. Some people gravitate being only **empowering** or **commanding**. Depending on the situation, we have to use those two traits appropriately. 

We need to be **commanding** when:

* People have no direction 
* Are in dire need of guidance

But ultimately we want to be **empowering**: 

* To really care about learning the situation of others
* To give personal growth instead of seeing them as dead end 
* To make them be independent and autonomous

The thesis of the definition **empowering** in today's society has been analyzed by *I.M. Panagiotopoulos* as `cheap` in the book *Modern Man*. An excerpt of that topic was placed for students to analyze on *2014 National University Entrance Exams in Greece*. We translate the excerpt in this post: http://ow.ly/ehT6303c0kz
