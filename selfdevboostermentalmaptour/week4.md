## Overview Of Meeting Tasks in Executive Paradox

The `Manifesto for Agile Software Development` in 2001 was the stepping stone for organizations to be more **Empowering** and flat in order for people to be more productive within projects. However, the reason why software development emphasized **Commanding** before was due to a deep care of the system and avoiding any entropy.

There are two problems with **Tasks**: What is a system if people can't use it? (Being too **Commanding** that **Tasks** don't align with **People**'s needs). What is a system if the system doesn't work in the first place (Being too **Empowering** that **Tasks** can't hold on the ground). We see both ends are futile and there needs to be a balance between the two for the **Tasks** to be practical and working smoothly.

In this post, we emphasize the flow of projects in software development. The **agile methodology** is many times misinterpreted as being too **Empowering**. Instead, the **agile methodology** should focus on having the least `business debt` and `technical debt` as possible for `competitive advantage` and `efficiency of costs`. We, the people, have the choice how much time to allocate to **Tasks** by being **Commanding** to keep our **Tasks** healthy and **Empowering** to meet **People** needs. They are a pair within a bike that they need to cycle together in order to be agile:

## In Software Development

In the following video, I express two personal experiences I had in the past within workplace environments: One of the projects was too agile while the other one was too structured. Being too agile or too structured can make a software impossible to maintain and deliverables not meeting clients and employees expectations correspondingly.

## In Governance

The balance of **Empowering** and **Commanding** is a concept that can be applied beyond software development. For instance, governing a nation faces the same challenges a software project has but in a larger scale. The austerity programs that were rolled out due to the 2008 Economic Depression of Greece was an example of being too **Commanding**. The election of the new prime minister that opposed those plans and the event of the 2015 Greek Referendum was an example of being too **Empowering**. Within the past 8 years, the economic situation was kept in a stall state. Only by paying attention to people needs will not solve the problem. Quoting my video:

>If that party thinks only for the people and the people, without changing the people's attitude clenching in the public sector, without the inception of an environment that promotes an innovative and productive environment, instead will bring a society where equality will be unfair, where common sense will show us that each citizen cannot attain same privileges, it will bring an idle environment where all people will not be motivated to bring something better in this competitive hungry world.

In the latest *CNBC article "Nobody believes anything anymore"* http://ow.ly/JbeD303OZiF , we see people attitude focused only for their own survival. Quoting:

>The second big thing is withdrawal. People have retreated to their families and fight only for the family survival. Society has been fragmented

>an increase in animosity between people, saying there was a widespread hatred not directed to anyone in particular, it's like all against all.

>In small cities you walk and you see people over 60 and below 20, Kyrimlis noted. It seems like my generation has vanished... indeed 400,000 have left Greece since 2007 (and these were) the brightest people

Recovery won't always be smooth and easy. Nonetheless, it requires an increase focus on projects that invest in innovation, as well educating the people on new skills, such as leadership and the application of the new fields of technology to make their working environment productive, efficient, and harmonized.

## Summary

We can learn a lot from the model illustrated in the book *Executive Paradox by David G. Jensen*.
