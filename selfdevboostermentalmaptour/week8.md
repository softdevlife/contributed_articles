# Education/Feedback: Tools For Creating Model In Our Minds

## Fixing The Cracks In Online Education
Two years ago, I complained about Q&A online portal StackOverflow & online courses like Coursera being limited [in one of my blog posts](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2014/04/coursera-is-missing-learning-style-of.html). The progress of learning has improved over the years since then. Coursera may not be the best experience on learning a material in depth, but it is good enough to get a basic understanding of some materials. Compared to two years ago, the list of courses has been curated for the content to be more qualitative. New features have recently been added to Coursera to make them [more interactive](http://coursera.tumblr.com/post/151160314982/now-available-in-browser-coding-on-coursera), similar to sites like Hackerrank. Furthermore, Stackoverflow is creating a [documentation open platform](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/stack-overflow-goes-beyond-qas-and-launches-crowdsourced-documentation/) that is more structured from their Q&A platform. Given online connectivity is a trait that becomes more prevalent to more people over time, there has been a steady increase of more general and niche online platforms that facilitate learning.

*You could only access Stackoverflow out of your own initiatives searching an answer to a problem through Google (Pull activity). Documentation is a new way in stackoverflow when you become auto-pilot on following specific domains/topics you don't know and want to learn more about it (Push activity).*

*Coursera courses are now curated and can be accessed on mobile. Lecture materials (even videos) can be downloaded to be viewed offline.*

## Education In Action
Almost 10 years ago (2007), my first part time job after graduating from high school was as a **Math tutor in the Math Center At San Diego City College**. At that time, the place that I worked was one of the top school environments that took advantage of all technological innovation. All basic Math courses were done with no instructor and grading was automated by students completing questions in the computer stations in the Math Center. It was all self paced where it was up to the student how long it would take to complete the Math courses he enrolled. Based on their commitment and effort, each student could complete their course in a few weeks or in a couple of months. The Math Center had a lot of ways to facilitate their learning if they had trouble. For instance, we had a lot of recorded videos from third party instructors that they could watch. In addition, they could complete math exercises related to their learning material with the bundled math software that was stored in the computer stations. And if all that didn't help, there was us Math Tutors for clarifying and facilitating any difficulties they experienced. The experience was no more different than Coursera except it required a presence within the facilities in order to access most of the facilitating tools and to complete the required quizzes to pass the course.

*San Diego City College Math Center looked like your typical tutor center, but with a bunch more of computers and completion of courses all automated.*

*Besides Math, English Reading is automated in elementary school with corresponding online quizzes. We know that education, in general, is not reactive to technology. If the [invention of the internet taught us anything](http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_arpanet.htm), education is indeed wild for technology. These years teachers even on [developing countries have tracking data of students to check on their performance by the use of computer tools that can do data analysis](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ht-top-schools-survey-2016-schools-use-data-analysis-to-keep-students-interested/story-bZmO60syHab0Ncef24nNjO.html).* 

Many people may see that online education is a threat to our society. Even more so, when Artificial Intelligence is coming around the corner, such as Duolingo, an online platform to learn languages, [recently incorporated chatbots to teach people new languages](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/duolingos-chatbots-help-you-learn-a-new-language/). On the contrary, I hope education, the main source of all new research and development, will find out how to fit these elements within the education workplace.  

## The Main Three Inputs Of Learning
I remember I had to complete my training in order to become a legit tutor in the Math Center by completing the **Tutor Training EDUC100 Class at San Diego City College**. Besides that I had to write a journal of the learning experiences I acquired by tutoring students, I also learned the three main types of learning a student acquires: **Visual**, **Auditory**, and **Kinesthetic**

Each of those types of learning has some advantages/disadvantages. One of thing we can tell for sure is that the shape of each input is different. 
* **Auditory**: Used for conversations. Sequential and practically not usually transcribed. It fits with people who can be analytical and have an elephant memory that can keep track of all past conversations.  
* **Kinesthetic**: A learn by doing approach. Input is more experimental and playful. Thus, it fits more with people that like to deal concrete experiences. 
* **Visual**: Primary input. Fits with people who love to associate. However, visual input can also be taken as a bridge to connect things in sequence (i.e. planning). For instance, in terms of language, words are labels to associate meaning to something we concretely experienced while grammar places the different type of words into a specific order. Another example is a map. A map can be taken associatively (`Turn from the hotel and it will be visible to when on the opposite side there is an entrance to an amusement park`) or sequential (`Go straight three blocks up, turn right and it will be in between the fourth block you pass through`). 

As a tutor, I took my own share and have found out that when it comes to people that learn from conversations, it was hard for me to keep up and I was not the best fit to take up that task naturally and was better myself to do those conversations by being prepared ahead of time. I am not good at explaining things in playful ways, so when it came to students that liked to learn from a *learn by doing* approach, I tried to remove that handicap by blending in some visuals in the blackboard for explaining the concepts. It seems that there are three ways for teaching a material and I was good at teaching things in a visual way. When it came to speech presentations that I prepared ahead of time in universities and meet ups, I was always praised more over the visual presentations in my slideshows that I associated with my speech.

Over the years and after reading many self-help books, I discovered that the goal of teaching helps us create an abstract model in our minds, debate existing ones, and incorporate our model with our identity. 

* **Creating An Abstract Model By Visual Input**: As discussed in [previous week module](https://github.com/softdevlife/contributed_articles/blob/master/selfdevboostermentalmaptour/week7.md), TMN cannot be conceptualized or understood without MMN examples. Visual input is one of the easiest ways to bridge abstract with concrete. When writing an essay, there is always a specific structure within a paragraph: Create an abstract point (an abstract generality:`The cats in mountain Eve are usually seen as black`) and support the point afterwards with supporting statements (usually in the form of a concrete example of cause and effect:`The cats in Mountain Eve often cross over a river that is filled with black ink,  turning their original color to black. Mountain Eve is so dark that every living thing looks like a shadow.`). For generalities that did not happen but want them to happen, we set those goals as **stretch goals** and place **smart goals** that can make that goal to happen. 
* **Debate Existing Models By Auditory Input**: This communication is a very popular form of medium used for debates, especially in [Philosophical arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQzK4XCXV7c). However, it is also used as the main form of giving feedback to others. The nature of auditory communication requires that only one person speaks at a time and participants to listen. That means that we have to go to auto-pilot mode and accept others input message and wait before we can auto-pilot others. 
* **Incorporate model to identity By Kinesthetic input**: Creates a reflection of our mental model. Doing exercises or putting our knowledge in a simulation/safe environment is the difference between knowing and **being** while doing the walk the walk.

### Problems with Kinesthetic Communication

The problem with kinesthetic communication these days is that we incorporate humans to have the same capacity as computers. Our model of our brain expects that given computers can do most of our tasks with less fuss in a streamlined fashion, we expect we can use that same model in humans as well. You can do a recap of Week 6: [Sully - The Nuts and Bolts Of The Airplane Industry](https://github.com/softdevlife/contributed_articles/blob/master/selfdevboostermentalmaptour/week6.md#sully---the-nuts-and-bolts-of-the-airplane-industry) that discusses the topic of [human factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics), along with my blog post [The ugly truth about face to face communication](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2015/02/the-ugly-truth-about-face-to-face.html)

### Problems with Visual Communication

What the problem with visual communication these days is that most of our expressions associate MMN, but do not bridge those MMN experiences to some TMN. Our attitude of how we approach visual communication is the difference between being reactive and proactive, to have control or mostly being influenced by others. The accessibility of books in the renaissance age let our civilization grow more intelligent by connecting concrete concepts with abstract ones. In contrast, cat videos and jokes are all great as a rewarding substitute. However, the more we engross with that content, the more our civilization will be living in the zen slice of life and less passionate on being aware of complicated abstract problems that need to be conceptualized in order to be solved. Read more about that in my blog post [From Renaissance to Tumblr](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2015/03/from-renaissance-to-tumblr.html).

### Problems with Auditory Communication

Given the nature of this communication, if not used correctly, we can abuse it by being too commanding or making the medium useless if we start interrupting others. This is the topic that we will mainly address in our next week module. We will wrap all the materials we discussed from **Week 5** to **Week 8** with the book [Feedback Revolution by Peter McLaughling](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0615890881/). You can take a starter by reading [my review of Feedback Revolution to know what it is all about](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1685493028)

## Afterthought I: Making Communication Better

Communication has two bottlenecks. How can we make the message:
* Reach as wide as possible 
* Easy to reach. 

Those two bottlenecks have been solved with the ability to transcribe content somewhere (i.e. books) and storing them in a structured organized way (i.e. library). In recent years, the cost of finding any content is minimized and takes no effort with the use of a search engine on the internet. Before books existed, people had to spend a lifetime to memorize the message of others and to pass the message later to others. Today we take the ease of accessing any information we want for granted, not knowing what our ancestors had to go through. We always forget the number of [communication lines for N people in a team that has to speak face to face](https://www.sitepoint.com/larger-teams-do-not-develop-faster/) as `C = N (N – 1) / 2`. There is a trend in online forums that if you don't know something, you should google it. In addition, there is also a trend in software development community that if you don't know how to solve a problem, you can stackoverflow it. We have to go even further than our current bottlenecks. Instead of asking others about a question in your internal organization, should you not document it somewhere so others could know about it? Even better, can you make that specific solution more generic and non-affiliated to your internal organization and publish it publicly so anyone can learn from it? **Many companies use open source code that becomes the main pillars to keep their business model in shape**. [The tragic irony is that most of that open source code was developed by developers who live a life that is too humble](http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure). I think money stimulus to open source code development will not bring as much as an impact as much people in internal organizations changes their mindset of thinking the world as **us** and **them**. [The bottom line value is the network effect we create from our output, we are all beehives communicating each other](https://hackernoon.com/the-hive-is-the-new-network-260b432a6720?gi=521f71d54161), and it is up to us whether we play this game smarter or not.

## After Thought II: Making Visual Communication Better

If you still have trouble understanding the problems behind visual communication, take a read of **Chapter 5 Starbucks and the Habit of Success on the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**. Taking notes during meetings, creating memo cards for a speech, planning a budget or activities you will do on a vacation are small sequential actionable steps that are the first step for being in control of what concrete experiences you want to be aligned with from the mental map that you have formed. The difference of choosing to control your destiny or let the environment influence us can be found on **Chapter 9 The Neurology of Free Will on the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**. In supreme court, there was a case that alleged that gambling could be similar as someone who killed a person unconsciously when they were asleep walking. Watch a podcast that [discusses that case!](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/466/blackjack)
