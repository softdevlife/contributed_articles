## Channels of Communication
![workstation_hires](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12673581/18409759/9197e0d2-7782-11e6-8cc1-e9b28ca65772.jpg)

In the following three weeks, we will discuss the channels of communication. How we give feedback on all those channels are important. However, being **active** on those channels and **taking in consideration the personal** becomes the main factor for the outcome of our life and society. The channels that we will discuss are:

1. Reading & Writing
2. Ephemeral Communication (Photos & Videos)
3. Face to Face Interaction

## Words - Reading & Writing

There was a lot of stuff that I learned in my **Business Law And The Legal Environment** class at **San Diego City College**. Of all the topics discussed in that class, the one that I was impressed the most was how the law treated **written and oral contracts** differently. **Written Contracts** are harder to alter a past agreement between people. In contrast, **Oral Contracts**, unless recorded, are not in concrete nature. In addition, they can be contested that the message transcribed in the recording was not perceived to be forced strictly in a serious manner.

This is, of course, starting to change with the internet recording everything in our life. For that reason, many people do not post any messages publicly. Ironically, applications like Snapchat et al, try to artificially make writing and snapshots to become ephemeral instead of concrete. There are two reasons for that:

**1. People mistakes taken as a dead end instead as a path to personal growth** (We will see more details on that when we discuss the book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed* and demystifying *John Locke On Personal Identity*).

Briefly stated, when a program that is not a virus makes a mistake, we treat it as a bug and we try to fix it. When a human makes a mistake, most society will put their career path as a dead end, no matter their past circumstances. In the latest movie **Sully**, the important message is not only whether the pilot did a mistake or not, but how we react when a person makes a mistake. Re-iterating the movie script, Sully portrayed by Tom Hanks says:

> Over 40 years in the air, but in the end I'm going to be judged on 208 seconds

**2. Due to that fear, people are not connecting concretely to the world of the Internet, which results not committing our identity to be filled out with content**

Just think about it. What would a server do alone without being connected to the other servers? All our world now is inter-connected with the world wide web. Without that connection, we would have not had such form of order within complexity where all our world is and is about to become more automated. It is indeed true that there are a lot of business people and users who use the software in a passive way, not knowing the whole process behind the curtains (in software development, we call that `encapsulation`). However, it is the active people, as well the government, who actively form and evolve this internet architecture, that are pulling the strings for determining the outcome of society's fate. Having an identity and improving over it is better than being in the ephemeral and being **Nothing**. As I quote from the article ["The Internet" By Lorin Friesen](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/internet.php):

> Disconnecting a computer from the Internet may be an effective way of avoiding computer viruses but it also removes that computer from the world of the Internet. Similarly, focusing upon individuality may protect a person from the abuses of self-denial but it also eliminates the possibility of participating in something that is larger than oneself.

## Conclusion

Compared to speech and interacting with others, words are the most concrete and tangible. Programs are written by words. Decisions are done by data analysis derived from data that is written by words and numbers. Machine learning automates high cognitive skills based on data that is derived from words and numbers. Some of the benefits of writing are:
* Writing it down can become useful to other people you don't know at all (i.e. Google Search)
* Writing things down in a public space makes you honest and transparent. If people don't put blame and is used as a lesson for learning from mistakes, it becomes totally invaluable (i.e. The `Black Box` of an airplane for investigating accidents)
* It is easier to evaluate things objectively, as we judge by the facts of the data, and not being affected emotionally by another individual through face recognition and speech recognition. That is another reason why people post `anonymously` bad reviews. However, that is suppressing the human component problem like a fundamentalist do, instead of understanding how people should deal interacting with real entity beings giving constructive feedback.

You can read more about writing [in one of my blog posts](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.sg/2014/04/why-writing-is-more-important-than.html)

In the next two weeks, we will discuss how people deal inefficiently the human component with speech and face to face conversations.

## Sully - The Nuts and Bolts Of The Airplane Industry

I really recommend for people to watch the movie **Sully**. It is a great watch in the preparations of the next months when we will discuss the book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed*. A big component of the topic of *Black Box Thinking* is dedicated to the aviation industry. Aviation industry may be one of the earliest industries that have applied the scientific process in all of its procedures. In order for the process to be done objectively, investigations are done by third party investigators that have a beginner's mindset to gain a more clear understanding of airplane accidents without having a personal bias. Furthermore, they are the earliest adaptors of making use of data and experimentation by the use of machine learning algorithms and simulations of aviation for identifying mistakes and the training of pilots correspondingly. However, even under those circumstances, we learn three important lessons:
* The data of machine learning can always have the possibility of being inaccurate. So we should not always take the token of value as the absolute truth. Our actions and attitude should always have some small space of flexibility to that. 
* We cannot expect humans can imitate machines on all circumstances unless they are trained or have past experience to similar events and have the physical capacity to perform those tasks. 
* We should not take people mistakes as a dead end. We should take several other factors into consideration before making a final decision.
