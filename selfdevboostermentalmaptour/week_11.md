##Introduction To Theology

![scientificmethod](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12673581/23884154/0d264982-08a6-11e7-92a8-20de84548d3f.jpg)

Welcome to this weekend module. In this weekend module, we will be discussing Theology. Just like Science tries to find through trial and error on how our world ultimately behaves, Theology motivation is to find if there is a general purpose constructed behind all the manifestation that we live within. We have to conclude that based on our perceptions, we could have parted away differently today if our ancestors looked things differently. Between choices, most people would prefer to live in a better world instead of making this place a disjointed mess. To those people, who focus on what we can do in our present world and not what is beyond our control, I am calling my voice for you today. For the experienced and mature ones who run the full course of this journey, you must know that the challenge is not only on embracing the idea, but how we can execute it on the address of our current situation. 

What we have executed well and what we have executed not well so far? What domains do we perceive currently in our world as deeds that progressively improve over time? The domains that we have improved well is on manifesting the external environment to our well-being, as well the ability to express and understand things from the multiple angles of our world view. In the past, it was a more common problem to have an adequate diet and live in a shelter that is safe and environmentally friendly. Things that we could spend hours or days on dealing our necessities and needs are now done in seconds at the level of comfort and convenience unimaginable on those days. In the past, people experiences were limited to exploring only to their close surroundings due to the absence of transportation and communication extensions we have to this day. Now we can get information not only from the few who distribute their message through books. Now anybody can have their own voice through the internet. What was not possible to explore through foot is now possible with trains, airplanes, and soon to come spaceships. We always take these things for granted. We never thought twice how we reached those destinations in the first place. 

All of this improvement of our surroundings was thanks to the scientific method. It was the urge of individuals curiosity on discovering how our world behaves, to understand what are the common universal principles that our world revolves around. All of this was done so we could execute a strategy on how we could fit those principles long term wise on our control instead of letting nature controlling us. But before we were able to agree on that mindset, the scientific method was deconstructed many times by people being too focused on short-term goals, mostly trapped on their present worldview. They believed their current beliefs were more than enough to delve around our world. They believed further investigation of our environment would not help in their shortcomings, giving little care on investing a portion of their time for a better future for our next generations to be. There was little motivation for people to work in math and science other than their own determination. It was only their strong belief alone and not of others that the world was able to set a brighter course. Even when those scientific principles came longstanding visible to our world, they were applied in the beginning for the wrong purposes. Instead of bringing a vibrant world that we have today, we distributed weapons of mass destruction. We were able to get over that shake up and make our world a better place instead. In our last weekly module, we will discuss how not so well known mathematicians had to face those adversities. They could traverse through only with the help of their own courage and confidence. You really required to have the most adamant and amazing bravery to do that.

There are two elements that we constantly do in order to progress our physical world to our advantage: marginal gains and innovation. Sometimes our innovation brings miracles to our world, but it does not reach wide due to not being implemented efficiently. It is a crime to our society for having great inventions that for years are expensive and not affordable, as fewer people will take advantage of using great goods that will make their life for the better. It detract us to innovate further as our current innovations are not something that everybody can take for granted. For that reason: optimization of our existing innovations helps us to innovate further. We should try to optimize existing processes that in today's world are perceived as costly. However, we should not cling on those processes once they are efficient enough. Optimizing existing innovations is like working with a kettle. When the water boils enough, there is a whistle that says enough is enough and we need to move on improving the next existing innovations that are not affordable. It will be a crime monetizing an existing innovation that is already enough affordable. All of those optimizations will help us on saving up more space on innovating on the next thing. Innovation is so critical, it is the difference between nations and cities that embrace it more or less about it, that the ones that innovate more, the more value they have, as the demand for great things needs great people. All the transportation and technology we have these days would not have been here in the first place if someone didn't innovate in the first place. We can see the product manifested by the scientific method as a partial illustration of Theology. It tells us a big part of our purpose is improving our external world via observing the world, making inductions, and testing them out if they work through trial and error. It specifically tells us the steps on how we should treat our world. Science should have its space of taking some ownership of what Theology actually means. We talk more about science and technology than theology in news and in the business world where we work in our day to day life. If theology is not only for talking but walks the talk, then it should represent our core purpose that we live. We should be dedicating it instead to as much hours of our active service within our life. Then my hypothesis is that Science should be a partial illustration of Theology. But did Science created the complete ideal process on aiming to make the world progressively ideal? As long we don't miss something out of our radar, let me confirm you that the external world is doing great and it could not have done more better on how it aims at handling things for our future. To some extent, I get sometimes bored and less excited in this domain, as most of the demand on the external world is very competitive and mostly fulfilled. But here is the ultimate question of our tour: Are the people themselves at their full potential in respect to others? I think there is a huge supply on that domain that we haven't fulfilled yet, just not expressed by people explicitly, only implicitly. One of my long-standing economist teacher said that when looking for a job, aim at the one that has the most supply and the least demand. This sound so simple and makes so much common sense. Then what should we aim for in the end?

Let us talk on what domains that are kept in negligence and in a stall state: human behavior and the motivations that drive the behavior behind. It is a sensitive topic that people do not want to address it by using the scientific method. Let us take a look on how psychotherapists deal patients from the excerpts of the Book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed*:

>Most psychotherapists gauge how their clients are responding to treatment not with objective data, but by observing them in clinic. But this data is highly unreliable since patients might exaggerate how well they are to please the therapist. Moreover, psychotherapists rarely track their clients after therapy has finished. This means that they do not get any feedback on the lasting impact of the treatment **(Black Box Thinking, Matthew Syed)**.

The author concludes how more effective it would have been if psychotherapists had a "standardized and proven interview procedure to assess well-being in their patients (in the same practices the airplane industry does to aim having the safest flight trips)". If you haven't noticed, this tour brought all those personal development books to the table on aiming at finding a standardization of making us humans our best resource to our self and to others. There are many people that will take life in a lazy way and selfish manner. I am not addressing this message to these people. I am addressing this message to people who look on making our world an ideal place for each other and want to make a big impact. However, to not only mesmerize on those ideals. I don't want people to obsess themselves in video games, such as Final Fantasy or playing Dungeon & Dragon board games by placing brave warriors that slay orcs and venomous dragons. I want people instead to place those ideas pragmatically. This would be no better said by the autobiography of *Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance*, who although admired working on video games, chose re-incarnating science by being pragmatic in order to bring more advances to our objective world:

>I really like computer games, but then if I made really great computer games, how much effect would that have on the world...It wouldn't have a big effect. Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games, I couldn't bring myself to do that as a career....I really was thinking about this stuff (instead) in college (the internet, renewable energy, and space)...It is not some invented story after the fact. I don't want to seem like a Johny-come-lately or that I'm chasing a fad or just being opportunistic. I'm not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way." **(Elon Musk, Ashlee Vance)**

Today, our world has a problem in facing mistakes and letting others make mistakes, embracing others and themselves on optimizing existing innovation, as well giving the courage to others and themselves on disrupting the world with new innovation. 

If a person was illustrated as a series of memories inside a film reel, we would make those memories look outside all rose-colored glistering through our social networks. But it is the failures that we usually don't accept that can let us grow and become a better version of ourselves. 

> We cover up mistakes, not only to protect ourselves from others, but to protect us from ourselves. Experiments have demonstrated that we all have a sophisticated ability to delete failures from memory, like editors cutting gaffes from a film reel – as we’ll see. Far from learning from mistakes, we edit them out of the official autobiographies we all keep in our own heads **(Black Box Thinking, Matthew Syed)**.

We are facing here on addressing new norms that most people will not accept them at face value within our social institutions. When violating norms, the main question we have to ask ourselves is this: Is it worth it? Is it functional? Were those mathematicians on the old time that try to break the norms worth it? To make our world a better place? Yes, it was. Yes, it is. We are already living the gifts from the sacrifices they have made. A same occurring pattern as in the pre-scientific period is happening now when we address problems in the social sciences: people deconstructing our ideas, not leaving any option to make any correct judgments for how our ultimate behavior behaves. Some group communities that advocate creationism put a closure on discovering and understanding more about our external world, as discussed on the bellow excerpt from the book of *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed*:

>He asserted that the world had indeed been created in 4004 BC, but that God had created lots of apparent fossils at the same time so as to make the world look older than it actually is. He also argued that Adam had been given a navel by God in order to give him the appearance of human ancestry when he was really created out of mud (the title of his book Omphalos is ‘navel’ in Greek). But this also meant that it could never adapt to meet the challenge of new evidence. In one way, Gosse had defended the theory of creationism in 4004 BC. His post hoc maneuver meant that the facts once again tallied with the theory. But he had done something else, too. He had made the theory invulnerable to failure. No amount of evidence, no amount of data, no amount of discovery could refute Gosse’s position. Any new information suggesting that the world was older than 4004 BC would simply be held up as further evidence that God had played a trick on the world. The theory was confirmed, come what may. But this also meant that it could never adapt to meet the challenge of new evidence **(Black Box Thinking, Matthew Syed)**.

If we do not have the ability to learn from our surroundings of the external world, imagine how more challenging it will be on learning how our human behavior manifests? The main problem with creationist was not whether the word of the Bible was wrong, but whether the creationist interpretation of the Bible was correct, whether they made a mistake and instead should have a different interpretation from it. If there is a hypothesis that a creator created the world and it gave us a general guide on how we should aim at making our best for ourselves, we should not close that opportunity. This is quite possible as the Bible and the events of Jesus are concretely there. It is no different from us creating machine learning instances in a simulation and giving them some guide on what they should do. But ultimately, whatever guide is given, we have to question and test it. After all, the Bible is very vague, like a riddle, that through trial and error, it may have the possibility that it will tell us something useful when the timing fits for us to understand. If anything, the Bible was a thing that for better or worse was the main inspiration for the dozen of civilizations, each viewing the same message of the Bible through different perspectives on the words it portrayed for constructing our world, views that could have been completely different at that time compared to how our current believers view the Bible. In addition, making the Bible sound like a riddle makes complete sense, as when we see the story of Jesus on this coming Good Friday, a riddle instead of a direct answer makes a conscious effort to validate if a person really understands the message. In the same way we validate these days whether a person is human or not by asking questions that a robot could not understand, Jesus tried to observe whether people were transformed or not by making vague descriptions on the way we should live our life that only people that were in the process of transforming themselves could understand. If the Bible has the chance to be valid, it has to make sense when it is applied to our present world, it needs to be compatible to what we observe. it has to be compatible with what most personal development books are saying to improve ourselves. This is our attempt on testing the waters of the Bible and see how deep down the rabbit hole we can go from it in order to become a better version of our self. This is a journey that I think current Science opposes to tackle because it is too sensitive, Religion opposes by clinging to some specific interpretation. We will go over that in general, in terms of the Bible, marginal gains and implementation represent "male thought" (Contributor Thought), innovation and design represent "female thought" (Exhorter Thought), "virginity" represents an innovation or design that has not been explored or discovered yet. Given the symbolic meaning of those words, I want to be poetic using those words symbolically now and say to all of you:

> I am here all alone traversing in an isolated road within the wilderness<br>
> Awaiting this journey will gift me ripe fruits to bear<br>
> Many roads have already been married<br>
> But this one still retains its virginity<br>
> I am one of the first ones that will valiantly touch it<br>
> Like the first mathematicians were able to witness it<br>
> Oh, the sacrifices we go for meeting such virginity<br>
> Hear my speaker deck, join for the greater good<br>
> For we will make heaven flesh out upon earth<br>

So let us go back to the story of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. One of the things that we can learn from Willy Wonka is that we all start with a childish mindset. That is the next topic we will be discussing. In one of the sections in the book *Natural Cognitive Theology by Lorin Friesen*, it describes the differences between the attitude of a child and an adult from Piaget's developmental stages. What is interesting is that many adults function with a childish mindset. To be an adult is optional, it requires conscious effort, it is very easy for us to cling to a childish mindset instead. We will go over the definitions of what a childish mindset represents and what a childish mindset behavior usually does. I have to re-iterate that this behavior for a child is completely natural, it is how we start, they will do over-generalizations, they will not know how to distinct what is right or wrong, as the brain still develops itself. In Willy Wonka, each kid in the factory has some specific vice tagged to its name. We have gluttonous Augustus, greedy Veruca, prideful Violet, Sloth Mike. Their vice drove them to ignore understanding the mechanics of the factory, leaving them to accidentally getting ejected from the factory. In contrast, Charlie Bucket tried to understand the mechanics of the factory and graciously inherited in the end the kingdom of Willy Wonka. Similarly, we can think of a human going into two phases: one with a childish mindset and one with an adult mindset. It is no different than how a butterfly hatches from a cocoon and goes through different stages, but instead of transforming ourselves only hardware wise, our focus is also on transforming ourselves software wise. It seems that transformation is mostly an option and not mandatory. It is up to us whether we want to switch our adult mindset on or off. 

Just before the scripture discusses the seven gifts that we discussed in our previous weekly module, *Romans 12:2* tells us to renew our mind by not conforming to the current pattern of the world, in the same way mathematicians tried to delve their way in the pre-scientific era.

> Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God **(Romans 12:2)**

Ready to explore the factory? Then let us go to our first exhibition: The differences between a child and an ideal adult from a cognitive perspective.

## Opening our doors to Theology: It is the meaning of the word that matters, not the current state of the word itself.
![bible](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12673581/23884359/2fce2bc0-08a7-11e7-894b-abcb59b042f6.jpg)

I will begin shortly on discussing concepts that will be used as a reference for describing a way of life that strives not only for success but for the ideal. However, I am pretty sure later on that most will keep their ears plugged when we conclude that there is a possibility that there is already a structured set path to follow (more specifically, a process) for placing all our efforts more "accurately" on striving closer to the ideal. Accuracy is very important, if anything, all that matters. After all, the word sin in Greek is hamartano (αμαρτανω) which refers to "missing a target". Just like science found general principles on how the physical world works so accurately and precisely, so our own self, our own human behavior, although more complicated, has to be analyzed. It was the precise accuracy, the measurement of all the temples of our physical world with the use of the scientific method, that we were able to manifest a partial illustration of heaven. Without this accuracy, it would have been impossible for our civilization to ever grasp on making sophisticated devices that facilitate our world, such as the computer. The product of science is a partial illustration of what heaven looks like. After all, that is one of the claims for why I stood so firm before to the scientific method. The scientific method has so much purpose to our world that it becomes a prerequisite if someone wants to become a core member of our future society. Our education forces us to learn stuff about how the world works. Our workplace forces us to analyze and understand how things work. This process is inescapable. Without it, we less add value and the less role we play in turning the wheels of our world one step forward. There is only one good ending and this seems to be about it. In a matter fact, for most of us, we already implicitly accept it and mutually agree. However, I have to re-iterate, this is a partial illustration of heaven. We have found on how to progressively advance our world physically. We have set that as our main priority within our investment and our dedication. However, we set the physical world so much as our top priority that anything else becomes second to none. We invest and spend more money on entertainment than for the improvement of our self. Entrepreneurs and government focus more on improving and optimizing our physical resources than dedicating time on improving the most important and creative resource that can make decisions by itself: our own mind, body, and soul. I do not know when, but there will be a tipping point where putting the same effort on improving the resources of our people themselves on making more better accurate ideal decisions will have more value than the sheer volume of physical improvements and optimizations we have done over the centuries so far. I do not know when that time will come and who will challenge that, but I know two ways this can happen. The path of suffering (the life of hard knocks) and the path of patience (understanding some principles that can be helpful in the future). The path of suffering is very straightforward. For a lot of time, people will be in denial for the path that is not ideal because the long term bad effects did not crop up yet. This can be illustrated by the example of the smoking and fast food industry. People smoked or kept eating fast food partly by their habits and partly because of their belief and the belief of its close relations that there is no evidence that the cause of those activities has adverse effects. The path of suffering shows that people will not believe and take action against new evidence until the damage settles in. Sometimes the path of suffering has to be so severe where only the next generation with fresh minds that see their parents in suffering are able to mold their brain in setting a different path. It took a lot of time to emerge a stronger interest and dedication on keeping people on a healthy diet and activity in their lifestyle. Similarly, our decisions and actions on how we deal with our self and others will become as important as how a person treats their own physical body today. There was a lot of ignorance on how we dealt our physical lifestyle before science kicked in. The same pattern is seen in personal behavior these days. Eventually, a treatment to make our behavior more accurately ideal will have to come.

We discussed previously from the excerpt of *Black Box Thinking By Matthew Syed* on how traditional psychotherapy inefficiently treats most of the time its patients. At the moment of writing, the discipline of psychology has been ridiculed by its methodology and partially rightfully so. There were a lot of researchers that did research for the wrong motivations, such as placing fame and wealth over the credibility of their work. Nonetheless, there are many researchers that still keep doing their work with integrity. In a matter of fact, we are getting more closer on the consensus that there are universal principles that can help us explain the reasoning of all our behavior, regardless whether that behavior accurately follows more or less to an ideal path. In the book *Stopping The Noise In Your Head by Dr. Reid Wilson*, Dr. Barlow, founder of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders who sits beside Dr. Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy thinks:

> One of our most important tasks is to teach clients how to step forward into their feared events in order to tolerate distress 'in general' and not simply tolerate the specific distress of heights, public speaking, claustrophobia, or other specific areas. Hundreds of researchers are now working to sort out which features of this universal protocol are the most essential. But I can assure you that they have already concluded that we need to be going toward, instead of backing away from, the unnecessary threats that stand in our way **(Stopping The Noise In Your Head by Dr. Reid Wilson)**.

We are going to view and treat the Bible differently from its current standing. First, we are going to look at it from a cognitive perspective. Second, we will treat the Bible only as a guide literally, not as a cheat sheet where no personal effort is required. In other words, the "real" answers lie in front of us that we have to figure it out by our own. Although the Bible can help us out, it will never be a source of light without us putting our own effort to understand and apply those universal principles out within our own context. As in *Richard Feynman's Philosophy of Science*, I quote:

> I can write down what it is for me to ride a bike - describe it terms of bio-mechanics or highway code rules - but none of this is how I do it, nor will it teach you how to do it **(Richard Feynman's Philosophy of Science)**

These two points give a completely different interpretation of the Bible. First, it is practical. It is not something that we have to wait. We can start contributing today on the next steps of the master plan. Second, it facilitate us on understanding how to transform our self by renewing our mind in the same way we transformed our physical world. We transformed our physical world by changing our mindset on how we analyzed our external information. The cause and effect of our external world were attributed in the past to an overgeneralization to an external force that cannot be comprehended. It was only when we tried to extract information from our environment, make a hypothesis and tested them out that helped us discover the actual cause and effect of our world than to rely on our wishful thinking cause and effect of our world. Many would say they are not sure why somebody had to put the effort into writing a book on how to improve our self when we were able to write a book by our own self on how the physical world works in the first place. If we can write Science and Math textbooks, why should there be a Bible? But who knows who came first: the chicken or the egg? Was the Bible an inspiration for the scientific revolution? How did the library of Alexandria in Egypt got formed? These are important questions that we should let alone not ignore. The Bible on those times were looked from a different perspective than how most presently see it these days. It was definitely not viewed as a mystery force that cannot be comprehended. Is it possible that humans could not understand their instrumentation alone or was it just to ensure the master plan had a higher success rate for becoming achievable? All I can tell is that these questions are hard to answer. But what we can answer is that Jesus story has a lot of consistency with the latest findings and practices on personal development, neurology, and psychology. It will be a shame to not plug in that information and evaluate it. After telling you my explanation, I leave it up to your hands, up to your own evaluation, whether there is any correlation with all the current findings we discussed so far on personal development. If anything, you will still be left with a lot of golden nuggets about personal development that can be practically used for making our society better.

There are several reasons why I motivate people to take another glance at what the Bible has to offer us. The Bible was inspired for all of our time in our civilization. Sometimes we took a step backward, but we ultimately took more steps forward. I also find out that many people can still get a lot of good advice from the Bible even when they do not fully understand it. So I still ask: Why not take another look that will be clearer than before? After all, the Bible has so much ground through its history that maybe we still missed something important from it after venturing to our scientific and technological wonders. All these weekly modules I write to you now would not have been here in the first place without the Bible. I am sure the book Natural Cognitive Theology was inspired by the Bible. I would have had lost the opportunity to gain so much valuable information on how to become a great model to our society. So I have to thank the source. I have to thank for the Bible being there in the first place. It is like a Butterfly Effect. If the Bible was not there, I wouldn't in the first place be talking to you right now about this weekly module. So let us give credit where credit is worth, not only selectively so we look good to others, but everywhere where we see worth to it. 

Although I have set my mind straight like a fist of iron that we have to renew our mind, I am not going to overlook intermediate steps that can help us reaching more closer to that ultimate goal. My insane mission of "Making the human reborn by renewing its own mind" is insane as Elon Musk mission on "Colonizing Mars". However, I will still be happy for my rest of my life if I venture on something that gets us more prepared or closer to becoming better models in our society. Similarly, Elon Musk SpaceX program focuses on making the space industry more affordable and efficient, giving more space for the colonization of Mars to become more reachable. So although I am loyal to my words, I will always do what is reasonable and logical to our current situation instead of dreaming and watching grass grow. However, my other goal is to spread the "message" of developing our own self for the ideal. That is the main reason I created this tour #selfdevboostermentalmaptour. I got so much helpful information and motivation to learn more about personal development after reading and understanding the theory of Mental symmetry. I felt accountable for receiving such fortune that it felt a natural deed to pass it out to others as well. I want to pass out that armor so you can as well bravely be able to cross on that journey. Metaphorically speaking, inheriting a fortune is great. But how much exponentially that fortune grows when you can pass that fortune through others? At that point, that fortune does not transform only you, it transforms the whole world. This is what this tour aims. So now that we are ready to take a dive on theology for theology sake from the perspective on transforming our self, let us check the differences between a childish mindset and an adult mindset by looking at the findings of Piaget childhood development.

##Welcome To The Factory

Welcome to the factory kids! Our motto in here is to be "reborn again". Let me tell you, I don't trust most current institutions telling us that they believe our slogan. After all, they got encompassed with sadness, fear, and over-protectiveness from the past commitments that touched the personal realm in destructive ways. I also admit that those past mindsets brought destructive consequences, making it completely sense to have doubts, as not all solutions can get us on the correct path.

Oh, brave new world, let us not choose one where we torment our people, but to instead give everlasting joy. Let us not our past keep us settled for ignoring our current personal problems, let us embrace with optimism through trial and error on making our personal growth, relationships, communication, and innovation better. Look how we were able to move away from the fears technology and science brought with the creation of weapons of mass destruction. We were able to hold our ground still with science and technology. That courage lead us to create a partial heaven that we have today. Otherwise, we would still be in ignorance, cursing anyone who observed the world and calling them witches for the miracles they prophecized. We would instead to this day have taken the physical world as a mystery, letting only the gods wonder our ruins.

It is up to us whether we want to build the other half of heaven as well. There is a lot of resistance these days. It is the same pattern as of how people in the pre-scientific era dismissed others' curiosity of the physical world. In contrast, today we don't only take curiosity for the physical world for granted, but also mandatory to add value to society. Then, my brethren, what do you think our future society will think on how we should deal our personal lives?

The factory is running in low production. Unfortunately, it does not have too much oil to keep up and running. Not all people can run this mill running. It is not what we are trained or be rewarded for it yet. However, you are all here to be tested whether you can harness the prophecy where it will liberate you to do miracles not only of physical wonder but of personal wonder as well. Rejoice, a huge opportunity awaits, you are on the right timing for catching a chance to catch a wide tide that most still not know how to reach. There is no better reward than to be rewarded for the future. It shows effort on pushing one step ahead over others that only look for a reward in the present.

I have to admit that currently this factory barely holds for itself. In this tour, I will only show the main highlights and as much far as I know about human behavior. The possibilities of expanding this knowledge and applying it in our world are endless. But for now, what I have will be good enough, a starting deck of cards, that I will show them to you how they can be played in this game of life.

Read my direction of my blog that deviated from discussing my personal experiences to discovering human behavior principles. That is how we reached up to be being here today. [Take a read.](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2014/05/direction-of-this-blog-site.html)

## Piaget Childhood Development

Let us start understanding the differences between a childish and an adult mindset. A childish mindset holds itself with Mercy Mental Networks (MMN) while an adult mindset holds itself with Teacher Mental Networks (TMN). We discussed the difference between those mental networks in one of our previous weekly modules. More specifically, MMN relies on personal experiences and events while TMN can be derived from MMN. It can be done the other way around as in TMN are taken independently and then applied to our own personal context. The latter method of acquiring Teacher Mental Networks is how most education is programmed: First, we learn a theory. Then we apply that theory to different use cases with exercises. Lastly, we apply those methods in our day to day working environment. Many will still think that a transformation journey only requires acquiring TMN. That is not the case. It has to be applied in a similar fashion as how the education system programs us to learn technology and science. We have to find personal problems to solve, ultimately becoming role model plumbers where we teach and clean others mess that are clogged in their system. In speech classes, the main mantra is "hearing is not a strong conscious effort as listening". Conclusively, the first step for our transformation after reading this material is to apply those concepts by understanding them and see how they can be applied in our own context.

First of all, it is easy to distinct between MMN and TMN by observing the age of each person. According to Piaget, the first years of our life are developed in MMN. The first two years are called the "sensorimotor stage". At that stage, the individual is mostly dependent on the environment. From ages 2-7, the child lives in concrete thought (Mercy and Server only), referred to as "preoperational stage". At that stage, the child looks cause and effect from their own personal experiences only. At this moment, the mind cannot use logic extensively to understand how things work. In other words, abstract thought is absent. Instead, it has to rely on personal figures they already experienced and fit them together with their own imagination, such as storks carrying babies or quoting from the book "human beings painting the cloud with white paint". That may be one of the main reasons why elementary schools start at the age of 6-7. At age 7-11, individuals are in the concrete operational stage. At this point, the student can formulate logic and create TMN out of MMN. In other words, the child can derive abstract thought out of concrete thought, but cannot derive abstract thought independently. For instance, a child will be able to understand three apples and two apples is five apples. However, it will not be able to understand a theory effectively without having personal experiences that tie the theory at hand. We also see most students graduate from elementary schools at age 12. Again, this is not a coincidence. We also see that the study material and the way the material is presented between elementary school and high school are completely different. An elementary school focuses more on concrete examples in order for students to acquire common sense. In contrast, a high school focuses more on abstract theories that require the use of abstract logical thought. That stage is called the Formal Operational Stage. Although an adult's development of Formal Operational Stage may seem from a cultural perspective that it ends at the age we become 18, most psychologists argue that it usually develops up to the age of 21.

So why are TMN important? Well, can we, from experience, illustrate what a child lacks? Of course, you will say that a child lacks nothing at all. After all, he is meant to be that way, is it not? Yes, after all, that is the maximum capacity a child can perform due to the limitations of the brain not being fully developed. However, it shows us how a child performs in an inadequate way, not because it wants to, but that is whatever it has at its own disposal. This is the main reason why we call children as being "innocent". Oh, but so how many excuses we do when we adults want to become a child. A plain excuse to become inadequate when we have the capacity to already be adequate. In order to keep things in order, we have to represent as responsible accountable citizens. As said previously, being an adult is just an option and many do not follow that option. As opposed to a child that does not know the difference between right or wrong, an adult has the capacity to be in denial of their personal flaws by hiding them on the surface. Let us go briefly what are the main detrimental elements that happen when we rely only on MMN. What is interesting also is that a lot of Data Science topics also come on the topic of our conversation:

**Transductive Reasoning**: Remember the example we gave previously whether a cat has four legs or five legs? What if we saw a deformed cat having five legs and that was the first time we ever saw a cat? Would we rely upon that all cats have five legs instead of four legs? That is what transductive reasoning does. Creating theories from single experiences yields a high risk for being an outlier. Our confidence will be low for generating such universal statement. It is only when the incident occurs often (when we see more incidents where cats have five legs) that we can be confident that this hypothesis is true.But what if transductive reasoning removes the use of logic? What if we remove the casualty? Then we create a universal principle out of one individual experience that cannot be replicated or repeated. Children are innocent when doing those observations because they cannot use logic until a later age. Quoting from the book, a child can think a bark of a dog can pop out a balloon, even when that incident was just a coincidence. In contrast, an adult can take a one night stand as a universal principle by removing the casualty over the encounter. Then those overwhelming emotions from that personal experience will create "alternative facts" (we will be discussing this concept next as "blind faith"), overriding actual facts, expecting different outcomes on how others' should treat us. So transductive reasoning is something we cannot rely, we cannot prioritize one incident with higher weight over others, and we need to use TMN independently to get the clearest picture of the casualty in order to avoid any bias.

**Animism**: Animism is used a lot by children. They use it to express their imagination into inanimate objects. Look carefully what I have said in my last sentence. They use their "imagination". Animism is an expression of our own minds, not the actual expression of the inanimate object. Sometimes we adults put some objects a significant experience over what they actually represent. Take for instance that we put more happiness over the physical possessions we acquire, ignoring what ultimately makes us internally happy: our good habits that makes us an example role model for others to follow and the good deeds that we do that progresses our society. Although the maxim principle is what really stands out from communism to embrace, quoting from the book, communism did not "evaluate" people and created an expectation that was surreal: All people no matter what, had the same value. We used our imagination making people appear better than what they currently actually are. That is a form of animism as well. Therefore, all people could gain control of the means of production. However, the actual value of those people did not have an internal understanding of how to run a factory. We placed more value to people than what they actually are without the capability on evaluating each person's flaws that they have to personally grow. They dismissed the personal effort that is required for a person to grow which comes at a personal cost. That is why the Communism system got overthrown overnight. In contrast, the Capitalism system has some evaluation system (such as supply and demand) that gets more accurately the state of our situation so we can adapt more accordingly. In today's world, we try to evaluate things by tracking our situation more than we could ever imagine. We are creating smart cities. That would not have been possible without the amount of data people log on our digital world.

**Artificialism**: Artificialism is placing something to replace over what is natural. This is when we tell children that the clouds are painted by people with white paint and storks deliver babies to our home. The reasoning behind that is because those topics to actually be understood require the use of abstract thought. In contrast, the child can only relate explanations only from the personal experiences that it can relate to. However, what is funny is that to this day we still put more significance over the people that discovered something instead of paying attention to the natural processes behind those discoveries that were discovered. We usually talk more about Einstein and Steve Jobs than the theory of relativity and making a better customer experience correspondingly. Like children, we rely on authorities instead of becoming independent from authorities. We have the power to not be dependent from authorities by using our own effort on understanding how things work. Fortunately, we live recently in a start-up world where the main goal is disrupting existing authorities while promoting work environments where the average laymen employee can figure out from observation what works and does not work instead of relying on experts. Experts can deviate from making rational clear decisions, as well hiding their own mistakes. This can be seen in the hospital industry where a lot of surgeries that contain risk are still imposed to patients, as well surgeons embracing a culture that covers up their own mistakes for not losing their own credibility and profession. When some professions cannot be automated, then what we need to observe is their mindset behind the operations they perform instead of relying on the perceived credibility alone. These will be discussed briefly in our last weekly module when we cover further readings of the book Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed.

**Magical Thinking**: Transductive reasoning usually comes with a dose of magical thinking in order to defend itself. Alternative facts are created by sensationalism. Any tactic that overwhelms our emotion makes it more challenging for an individual to discern between an actual and an alternative fact. Children by default have most of their mind disabled on discerning between an actual fact and an alternate fact (It requires the use of logic from the Perceiver Cognitive Module). As adults, we can still switch our self to magical thinking if we are in front of an authority (or acts as an authority by the use of strong confidence) or when a particular message overwhelms us emotionally. Those are some quick hacks where the mind can let its guard off and disable our Perceiver mode to function naturally and instead take those alternative facts as a source of truth. It is like jamming our computer firewall for being temporary turned off. There is a lot of engagement these days from the press to data scientists that want to put a system in place where we can distinct between an alternative and an actual fact. Although a system will be very supportive, the biggest impact is educating on the process instead of the specific examples that we get mislead on believing alternative facts. After all, avoiding specific examples can result in false positives, as well anybody with a creative mind can find new alternative ways and themes that can still mislead us.

**Centrating**: This is a particular trait that is not only seen in children but very occurring to adults, especially a person that is conscious within the Mercy cognitive style. When some wrong incident occurs to the individual itself, everything suddenly revolves around themselves, dismissing the situation and feelings of others. This can last for a long period in children by crying relentlessly and doing tantrums. Centrating may be the antonym of looking at the big picture. And without looking at the big picture, our inductions and deductions will revolve on some limited knowledge that cannot be applied universally.

**Egocentrism**: Egocentrism happens often in children. An easy way to distinct that is when children think everybody else has the same obsessions as they do. Quoting from the book, "daddy likes Sesame Street because the child likes Sesame Street". Sometimes, we even as adults do offers to others without reading what they like. We give them what we like instead of what they like. When we don't involve in other cultures or in other disciplines beyond on what we are experts of, the more we will think that my culture and my discipline is something everybody should revolve around, when it is not. These elements can be seen very bold within Patriotism or social groups that they feel being "special" from the rest. This could not be illustrated better than how the high-class social group felt before the French Revolution. The palace of Versailles was a place for the royal and the luxury is yet to marvel to this day where tourists visit frequently daily to this place. Quoting from the book, "Louis XIV, the Sun King famously stated that l’état, c’est moi (I am the state)".

When we embrace Teacher Mental Networks, we get a more clear picture of reality. In contrast, Mercy Mental Networks have the potential to take control over Teacher Mental Networks and spin them around their own worldview, limited to their desires than what universally applies. We discussed on our previous weekly module about the categorical imperative by Immanuel Kant. Just like the categorical imperative, Teacher Mental Networks try to find universal principles that can be applied in all use cases. When they do not, Immanuel calls them as "radical evil". Transductive reasoning without casualty, forming animism and magical thinking out of sensationalism, artificialism that is dependent from authorities, and centrating/egocentrism to a limited domain are all elements of radical evil. For more information, read **Chapter 3 Piaget and childish thought** from the book *Natural Cognitive Theology by Lorin Friesen*.

What I found very interesting from observation is that most educators really resonate to the theory of Mental Symmetry compared to the rest of our institutions. After all, this theory was given an attempt to be applied in *TESOL in CELT 2014* conference. It seems that educators can see frequently the behavior of children in elementary and high school behaving in the above elements we just discussed. They have more space to believe in the theory that we have different type of agents in our mind: one encompassed on individual experiences (MMN) and another one based on theories (TMN). They have a grasp of Mercy Mental Networks because children express innocently their inadequacies. They can have a grasp of Teacher Mental Networks because that is what academia mainly lives. In the book *Mind What You Wear by Professor Karen J Pine*, academia focuses so much on theories that they do not care about the individual clothes they wear or whether they carry the latest gadget phone. Quoting, "although wander the corridors of academia and, believe me, you’ll think some of them haven’t looked in a mirror since 1974". They are so trapped in theories that they become so emotional about it. More specifically, quoting from the book:

>That is because a mental network only becomes obvious when it is violated. As we shall see later when discussing technical thought, the scientist is capable of highly rational thinking— when interacting with colleagues who share the same TMNs. The emotional response emerges primarily when the existing paradigm is challenged, usually by some outsider coming in with a strange new theory. Kuhn’s book triggered a firestorm of response. Similarly, I have learned through personal experience that a rational scientist can respond with intense emotional belittling when exposed to a competing theory. And this emotional reaction will usually be phrased in the personal language of mental networks. The response will not be “your theory has some flaws”. Rather, it will be “You have wasted your life. You do not know how to think rationally. You need to stop what you are doing. Your theory deeply offends me. **(Natural Cognitive Theology, Lorin Friesen)**

It sounds like the education system has a perfect environment because they have all the personal experiences (MMN) to derive a theory of what they observe (TMN). However, it would be even greater if the rest of the population, such as me, could understand this theory independently. In other words, to use their formal operational stage instead of the concrete operational stage.

We close up our discussion with a recent popular cartoon series. There is a popular cartoon show called *Yokai Watch*. It is very suitable for children living between preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. Basically, the story revolves around the idea that there are mythical creatures that we give them ultimate authority for any problems that we encounter, whether it is some form of cold or doing something inappropriate. In other words, the mythical creatures express a form of artificialism for the children as a temporary way to understand the world.

## Alternative Facts And Blind Faith

How do alternative facts become formed? By the use of Blind Faith. What is Blind Faith? Anything that can mesmerise our self either through the status of an authority figure, by being too sensational, or by repeating the same message several times. What they both share in common is that they overwhelm us emotionally. It is that overwhelming emotion that freezes our mind to use logic for evaluating any incoming fact. How can you win over the logic of others? In cultures that do not respect etiquette and courtesy, the one that will win the argument will be the one that screams the most and makes the loudest voice with speech intonations that embrace fear. The one that overwhelms us the most emotionally wins. Well, that is not a good way to handle things, even in front of meddling throughout injustice. What happens through this tactic instead is that we accept any incoming fact regardless of its nature as a source of truth. The fact has not gone to a screen pass test and by default, most people will not notice it. What is going behind all this process? Well, are there other situations that our clear mind becomes foggy? Think of when we have to perform in front of a large crowd or something that makes us feel uncomfortable when we venture somewhere that is out of our comfort zone. They all both lack self-esteem. It is more like we do not trust our own judgments and instead have to rely on others for second thought. Whether forced by others or by the course of natural events, that is when our mind is not clear and keeps our Perceiver cognitive module disabled. Perceiver cognitive module is used for evaluating facts. It is more like a statistical brain. After many samples received, it can tell whether the next sample received whether its common or an outlier. The Perceiver mind can be tricked by others by jamming its evaluation process by the use of overwhelming emotions. Perceiver runs its engine out of confidence. If a Perceiver represents a car running its course uphill on a mountain, some crumbling rocks lying on the street will not make its ride uncomfortable. However, if all of a sudden the mountain starts to have an earthquake, all the rocks will start falling down from the cliff, making that trip literally one hell of a ride. Similarly, a Perceiver cognitive style is very good at keeping a blank face to others after all the emotions are thrown back to him. Pass over his emotional threshold though and he will also start to crumble. When a Perceiver does not do his job that he is supposed to do and mix instead up himself emotionally, then like how a basketball team would end up with a loose defense, it lets others score over us seamlessly in the game. That leaves others with fake facts and fake news to get over to us and accept them as a source of truth. Quoting from the book *God, Theology and Cognitive Modules by Lorin Friesen*:

>Belief and emotion interact. The level of belief determines the emotional intensity that a fact can handle without falling apart, while the overall level of belief within some context determines the emotional intensity that Perceiver thought can handle in that context without falling apart. For instance, suppose that I look at the moon through a telescope and see no evidence of green cheese. If my father insists that the moon is made of green cheese, then my belief in the fact that I observed may be sufficient to survive the emotional influence of my father. But, if Dr. Jones, who is a world expert upon lunar matters, declares that the moon is made of green cheese, then the emotional status which my mind gives to Dr. Jones may cause me to doubt the fact which I saw with my own eyes. Because belief determines the ability to handle emotion, the diagram of mental symmetry uses the label confidence rather than belief or certainty. If Perceiver thought is functioning, then the Perceiver label of belief will be the result of Perceiver thought. However, if Mercy emotions overwhelm Perceiver mode and prevent Perceiver thought from functioning, then belief will be determined by Mercy emotions and will be imposed upon Perceiver thought. When belief is determined by Mercy emotions, then I will put the word ‘belief’ in italics or refer to blind faith. **(God, Theology & Cognitive Modules, Lorin Friesen)**

I further recommend reading the article [Crony Beliefs by Kevin Simler](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/crony-beliefs/) which argues the same topic in more detail. Quoting from the article:

>But perhaps the biggest hallmark of epistemic cronyism is exhibiting strong emotions, as when we feel proud of a belief, anguish over changing our minds, or anger at being challenged or criticized **(Crony Beliefs, Kevin Simler)**

So what type of belief do we want to have? One out of blind faith or one out of a faith that comes evaluated by our Perceiver Mind? I hope you all chose the latter. After all, the path of our journey is one that relies on understanding. When a belief is derived out of blind faith, then eventually it will not be solid. It will be melted away from surrounding facts that do not fit with the belief they have. Creating a belief is a delicate process: It is personal, it takes time, and the choices are limited. We can conclude that a belief is more sensitive than a habit. A belief represents a TMN as opposed to MMN. Most people will ultimately put a closure on our belief and get along with it due to how complicated and time consuming it is to form a belief in the first place. If the belief comes out of blind faith, then people usually make explanations that contradict with their belief out of their own imagination. That represents "Cognitive Dissonance" as discussed in the book Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed. What happens when a cult finds out that the deadline of the apocalypse that would come in a form of a spaceship would pass away? Well, their imagination will stunt you. Quoting:

>without any sign of a spaceship (still less a flood), Festinger and his colleagues watched the group in the living room (Keech’s husband, who was a non-believer, had gone to his bedroom and slept through the whole thing). At first the cult members kept checking outside to see if the spaceship had landed. Then, as the clock ticked past midnight, they became sullen and bemused. Ultimately, however, they became defiant. Just as Festinger had predicted, the faith of hardcore members was unaffected by what should have been a crushing disappointment. In fact, for some of them, their faith seemed to strengthen. How is this possible? After all, this was an unambiguous failure. Keech had said the world would end, and that a spaceship would save true believers. Neither had happened. The cult members could have responded by altering their beliefs about the supernatural insights of Keech. Instead, they altered the ‘evidence’. As Festinger recounts in his classic book When Prophecy Fails, 14 they simply redefined the failure. ‘The godlike figure is so impressed with our faith that he has decided to give the planet a second chance’ they proclaimed (I am paraphrasing only a little). ‘We saved the world!’ Far from abandoning the cult, core members went out on a recruitment drive. As Festinger put it: ‘The little group, sitting all night long, had spread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction.’ They were ‘jubilant’. **(Black Box Thinking, Matthew Syed)**

We close up with blind faith with one of my old blog posts *The X is the word*. The X is the word elaborates about how we get influenced by authority figures and by constant repetition. It gets us to believe in alternative facts. In the old times, indigenous people believed birds and things they could not reach as authority figures that they had to respect in order for nature to be kept in peace and under control. In contrast, in today's world, those authority figures were replaced by science and technology that gave us actual control of our universe that we can prove it without relying on a hope that is not solid, encapsulated by blind faith. Those gods were replaced by universal principles on how our world works. Respectively, do we trust on the "correct" God for our own personal salvation? Or are we trusting on a god of peace that cannot be applied in our current world, like the birds and the sun indigenous people believed? The X is the word was influenced by "The trashmen - Surfing Bird". So sing with me and tag along as we venture on the old times.

So we are all settled to start defining what God is really all about! Lets get settled, define what God is, and check whether you can put the extra commitment to it.

[![thexisthewordpicture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12673581/23884886/a70f574c-08aa-11e7-9eda-65935a5641fb.png)](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2015/02/short-snapshot-2-x-is-word.html)

## What is God

Oh, we are finally here! The answer that we were fully waiting for! But please ask yourself again over what we have gone over. Will the definition of God rely upon my expression of words alone or will it rely on what we observe and can be applied? Will your belief rely on blind faith or derive from our current observations of our world? That is an important question and I am testing your commitment to it right now. Ah, let us get straight to the point, shall we? What are the elements of what God represents: God is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent. God lives within "us". Of all possibilities, how can this be possible? It is possible. But how? In what form can God be? Can God be in physical human form? Someone we can relate to as a friend? Can it fit within those elements we just described for what God represents? Or are we going to use our imagination, creating a cognitive dissonance for still fitting that interpretation in our head? Well, let me tell you: God is abstract. God lives in Teacher Mental Networks, not in Mercy Mental Networks. It represents universal principles within our world and it is up us to discover the nature of God, to see where this stream of water ultimately ends us up to. The Mathematician Dirac did not believe the existence of God portrayed by MMN within our current society:

>If we are honest — and scientists have to be — we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can’t for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way (Heisenberg, 1971) **(Natural Cognitive Theology, Lorin Friesen)**

However, later in his life, Dirac accepted God portrayed in TMN:

>It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe (Dirac, 1963). **(Natural Cognitive Theology, Lorin Friesen)**

All these things will be very hard to digest at first, especially for people that want a God with immediate results that require no personal effort that comes at a personal cost. This requirement is completely different to treating people as a dead end when they do a mistake by not giving them more opportunities for their personal growth. The problem is this: I know most of you have set a closure of your own beliefs already. I am setting my own closure as well after I wrap up this tour. Most likely you got fed up and instead stick up to something and go with it. It is better to have something than nothing after all. After all, we all have to stand up for something, ain't that right? All of us, even atheists, have some model in our heads on how we should live in our world. If we believe in our model that we should be careless and negligent, so it will be. If we believe we need to be responsible and make our world better, so it will be. What I care is not what model you ultimately place in your head, but what model makes us more effective as a society. We found out that putting the scientific method as a model in our head helped us on making a partial heaven to our world. What else is need it to make our society more integral? Finding the nature of ourselves. So far, we described a lot of ways on how we can improve ourselves, from avoiding the elements of a childhood mindset to understanding the rest of the obsessions and cognitive modules we are less aware of. What we will find out is that Jesus represents a symbolic representation of our salvation. We have to see Jesus as King Of The Kings instead Jesus as the man. I know that all of those topics we discussed so far could still stand without taking the story of Jesus at hand. However, if our creator created a guide just for the sake of helping us and save us, should we not just consider to put it in the light of all the independent information we have collected so far and see whether they fit or not? That is what I am doing, and just like our mathematician Dirac, I believe our God is a mathematician of a very high order.

However, we have an obstacle. Oh, you found it already? Yep, it is you. Ah, you have a Teacher Mental Network in your head and is full of anguish I believe. After all, as said previously, Teacher Mental Networks are not easy to replace. It takes so much time to understand a new theory and believe in it that you have already set closure on your current beliefs. One of the things is that I know why people do terrorism. I know why people engage in wars. It is all because we violate others beliefs. All we can do is respect their beliefs. They may have other problems that are bothered in their life. Putting them to wear a different set of lenses will only make them more confused on their surroundings, let alone adapt. If divine sovereignty falls to us one day, we have to help our brothers on learning those foundations we just discussed instead of leaving them apart in their confusion. If you are still reading this, it is up to you whether after reading all this whether there is a better model version of what you already believe for what is our ultimate purpose of life. If you are ready for that commitment, then settle for a ride by reading the book [Natural Cognitive Theology by Lorin Friesen](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Cognitive-Theology-Andrew-Friesen/dp/0987978519/), as he evaluates each religion under the true colors of Theology. There are some that want us to still be innocent children again. There are some that want us to disable our Perceiver Logic. There are some that want us to believe things through blind faith. But I am not going to put more effort on explaining those topics throughout this tour. You have to venture all alone by your own accountability and commitment on embracing the anguish that you will have to face after reading a whopping 450 pages about the flaws each religion has. If you cannot afford the book, you can surf the site www.mentalsymmetry.com that covers the same topics as well. So, what are you waiting for?
