# Feedback And Our Obsessions

## An Introduction To Obsessions

You may think an obsession as a territory that awakens our mind and anything else beyond that as being asleep. Obsession at primitive format is how we make children follow a goal by a concrete reward (since their pre-operational mindset does not understand at that point abstract goals). For instance, we get good grades so you can earn a five-star sticker on your forehead or (less obvious) a paper degree of your achievements. An adult mindset may even think education still as a concrete way in earning a reward, such as more money. However, the underlying source (or the abstraction behind it) for *why* education can generate more money is dismissed, that people aim at something correct with wrong motivations. So the premise is that people will pay attention to do something good if it will progress them in some way closer to their obsession. The saying goes like a parent saying to their child, *"You will get this if you do this"*.

Now look at the example on the image bellow. Bob and John have a conversation and both meet their needs by fulfilling their obsessions. Another interesting note to take is that although each has a different obsession, they can be filled in the same *location*. Let us think the location in abstract ways based on skills of whether Bob can create his own donuts. The better Bob's cooking skills on making donuts, the closer the location it is to get from John a VIP discount on buying his coffee. What if John is a very hard demanding person to fulfill and he needs fifty instead of three dozen of donuts deliver to his doorway? Then it may be Bob's better ability to determine economically whether it is more worth for Bob learning how to make his own coffee on his own or not.

What we learn is that each of us has our own obsessions, whether our obsessions lead to a dead end or not is another lecture, but for this lesson, we take note that mental networks that we form in our mind are what we are trapped with, and anything that we hear from others that are out of the bounds of our obsessions will make us feel uninterested. What we have seen is that a contributor person or a contributor strategy will be very obsessed with some set of desired obsessions. We see that pairing two people with the same contributor personality that has different obsessions usually clash in an instant. That happens often when obsessions are in *different locations* (they are not all in the coffee shop). The point is we cannot move a person from location A to location B. There may be good natural reasons why a person chose location B that he is happy and works for him. It may not help for us, but it may help for others that we do not notice.

### Understanding The Obsession Of Others

As this [article 'The Story Of My Addiction'](http://observer.com/2016/06/the-story-of-my-addiction/) of a CEO portrays, an obsession usually has a lot of hardships by its own nature and it is usually always motivated by good reasons done in pragmatic ways. Envy or clashing will make them more unfaithful, less sober and more towards to a drunken world of unrighteousness. Encouragement is all they need while motivating those obsessions to be harness in a positive way. Although we may not know the location or are familiar with their obsession, we all know the general feeling of an obsession that motivates their role on doing something good in overall: 

> There is no 'training' ... other than having close friends and a support group to reach out to in your dark days.

On the next parts of our ongoing *feedback revolution module*, we will see how can we give feedback to obsessions that work together in the same domain effectively (which mostly the book *Feedback Revolution by Peter McLaughlin* discusses), as well to the ones that are in different domains.

## Obsessions That Work In The Same Domain

Let us look how obsessions work in the same domain. Obsessions in the same domain can be figuratively visualized as two sets that are independent, yet intersect together on some commonality. The proportion of the characteristics that are common matters in defining whether this relationship is more in the same domain. If both sets have so much in commonality that it becomes indistinguishable to the point it is like pronouncing the same word, then it is more like both sets represent the same individual. On the other hand, if they share very little in common, then by default, there will be no main purposeful point of interest for interaction. A good indicator to that is whether there is a big number conflict of interest or if any of those conflicts are deeply obsessed by their executive minds. A domain can be defined as a set of people working in a business organization, a team, or a nation with a specific culture or religion, all sharing a common vision by executing a route that will get them in haste to their ultimate destination. That vision is so strong that it can eliminate the rest of their differences. The interests of individuals must be different in order to call it a relationship. That is why different personalities or cultures are encouraged to be on the same team. Not for working out with their differences, but for bringing out their different strengths and perspectives that can bring positive impact on a vision that each member of the team share together, as that is the ultimate piece or contract that connects them together. It is more interesting to see how a fractal world with their own different mindset of the same obsessions can compliment in the complete picture of transforming a domain to its complete form (similarly in our previous weekly module, we discussed the differences between male and female gender and how can they complement each other within a relationship, not only physically, but also metaphorically in our female and male part that are located in our one and only brain, when we become lacking in general ideologies and specific practicality respectively). That is completely different when only one individual tries to tackle everything. I am not pointing out individual work is effortless. In contrary, one individual alone can be a catalyst for a new direction to our world. What I actually mean is that we live in a society, not in a container trapped with no internet. You can see the elegance of a book by an author. But to really "live" in it, the book must be applied by people executing its principles from all shapes and forms. Learning science and physics from a huge book that is full of numbers is completely different from extracting that information in a specific shape or form by i.e. building an airplane, allowing individuals enjoying the possibility to travel in other countries seamlessly making it tangible within their lifetime to learn new cultures and ways of life. The same applies to all the supporting material I am providing to you now for the words "Perceiver", "Teacher", "Mercy", "Server", "Contributor", "Exhorter", "Facilitator" so far, which represent a part of the theory of Mental Symmetry. It is all elegant, but being stuck in the process of how elegant it is will warp us to the ultimate intention this theory keeps in mind (to as well execute it like how airplanes from science fiction got physically real in our world by the use of the words of Math and Science that comes from it). Organizations have their own departments, teams have their own specific roles. In relationships, we handle what we like and let others do what we do not like or are better at. Let us see next how Feedback revolution discusses on how people within teams should give feedback.

### Perceiver: Can Bridge Different Domains In An Indirect Way

If you haven't noticed, so far we are creating a mental map. How we create a mental map is Perceiver collecting different information (in this case, our sample of information comes from books from several categories: personal development, leadership, neurology, communication) and try to form a general picture, a hypothesis, or a generalization of how the world works. In other words, we help *Teacher* (who is in charge of creating theories) to make elegant theories. Sometimes, these theories become *castles in the air* (has no application or relevance to life at all) or they may be messy but pragmatic by *hitting the rubber to the road*. Those can be more useful and refined later. Well, in this weekly module, we are not going to discuss only how Perceiver helps Teacher (or Tasks to say the least). Instead, we are focusing how Perceiver can help Mercy. But believe me, only *Server* or Commanding that comes **only** within our self and not from others, has the power to really transform our own identity, our *Mercy* cognitive module. For difficult situations, such as the ones where our obsessions are different from others, we will explore in detail later how Perceiver will work well that out in an indirect way. There are two ways that those can work well out:

* For finding a common interest that can eliminate the rest of the differences that transforms a relationship from different domains to one that becomes of the same domain.
* For finding the possibility that unfamiliar domains to us actually brings positive value to the big picture of things and respecting their contributions of their obsession or cause that they are driven for, treating them more correctly than our previous bias we had before.

### Giving Proper Feedback On The Same Domain

For our easy situation where we can mingle easily with people (as we assume they belong on the same team), all that matters is:

1. See if they can complete a new goal they are not aware of by letting on their own initiative find any set of Server actions that can reach to that point.
2. If they do not follow any initiative of the advice given, check why they think it is not a problem for them (read out their situation).
3. Understand people sensitivity on changing their set of beliefs. You have to initiate often and repeatedly 1 and 2 to adapt to their situation and for them to gain enough encouragement for having more courage to implement their new course of action. It takes time not only on the muscles physically, but also mentally for changing past conflicting beliefs. It requires patience, whether the problem is "our feedback" or "others reaction" to that feedback, what is "natural" will eventually come in the long term whether this feedback gives potent or not potent results.

Communication is either automatic or we reverse-engineer someone to fix something so it works well properly. Automatic communication is small talk and we do not account as giving feedback. Reverse engineering someone in order to fix a bug in their *software* on the other hand is the whole point why we give feedback to others implicitly. It means that we believe they are a little bit stray away from the actual destination and we poke around it. In order for any feedback not only be successful but comprehensible, we have to follow those three above points repeatedly in order to *align* correctly, not only for others to follow the Server actions on their own (as the most genuine way for their actions come from a faith that comes from themselves and not from *others*), but to also check whether our feedback is correct or not in the first place. The use of speaking strikes very well in here as it is more responsive than writing, as well the use of tone can make the message more personalized to their situation. In contrast, we will see that writing will be more effective when the message cannot be taken at face value, which requires time and patience by looking the same message multiple times before it gets well digested, when the message is universal that it can be applied to a larger audience or for understanding other domains that we are not familiar with. That is one of the main reasons why my supporting statements for the theory of Mental Symmetry is in writing.

### Feedback Revolution: Improving The Mercy Me

So without further ado, read my blog article that discusses the first half part of the book “Feedback Revolution” by Peter McLaughlin that tells us basically those three principles in action. In order for it to be effective, we should not be dominating others on their action or set blame for any mistakes they did. Doing that will make us be in control of others instead letting others learn from their mistakes independently. In addition, we should always ask others whether our feedback misses anything important or whether there are any objections to it. In the old times, old coaches could yell and blame others like: 

> Mike! You did it wrong! Why you didn't listen to me!? Here is how you do this! Do you see!? When are you going to learn?

Compared to:

> Mike. Oh, we lost that play badly. I feel sad. We will need to regroup and think. You think you can handle it, buddy? I have some ideas on what went wrong, do you want to listen? Do you think any of my points are not correct? Did I miss anything?

Those communication patterns are done not by playing catch up but as early as the event occurred as our mistaken actions are the easiest to reference at that time, as well to not snap out withholding all our views slipping down the line until those mistakes of the other person are beyond recuperation treating them like a dead end. Boiling our opinions for later is bad as maybe he is doing perfectly fine and we got it all wrong or maybe he doesn't have any clue unless you tell your points in the first place. My mantra is always express your feelings no matter what. However, it is much better and more effective to express them at an early stage where you don't have to snap. The point is to not dominate on others course of learning and you can't make that any easier when you are about to snap. In addition, we see that a Mercy mind at heart may not think that way and be dominating (for as we will see later in the next week module, it gets influenced a lot based on happy and sad experiences from individualized events). Though that may not be absolutely true in all cases, I also express that an organization that works in industries with a focus on the Mercy component can have a bigger factor warping their feedback into a Mercy dominated way.[Take a read](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2015/06/feedback-revolution-improving-mercy-me.html)

## Obsessions With Different Domains

### Converting People With Different Domains To The Same Domain By The Common Ground Of A Platonic Form

When obsessions are different or irrelevant to individuals that we talk to, then there will not be any enticing reason to listen to the feedback of others. One way to alleviate that problem is by finding a common ground. A common ground is created by Perceiver creating a mental map that all people that we interact with can agree with. Of course, this can also be used as a social engineering tactic to manipulate people in a platonic form they don’t genuinely mean or they don’t have any idea how they can make those plans possible. We are not talking about those cases. We are talking about platonic forms that can be applied to real life and are genuinely meant. Think of the hospital platonic form as “Saving as much people as possible” or the education system platonic form “to try every individual use it's most potential in their day to day life”. All organizations usually have a platonic form which they call it either as a *vision* or *mission statement*. Let us go to a case of a common ground that challenges the personal realm. Let us take the example of the [Iran Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution), where even a game was produced last year called *1979 Revolution Black Friday* to educate the public of the events. Iran people have their own differences with each other, whether that was their religion, political ideologies, and culture lifestyle. However, they all shared the same idea that the monarchy should go away. The last King of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was called the "king of the kings" by running the economy into the ground, let corruptions consume in the Imperial court, and would stop at nothing to silence the voice of opposition. This is the classical story of the one individual dominating the rest of the world. However, despite all the differences of the people in Iran, they all hold together on the common ground to remove this monarchy regime despite their current circumstances being in good shape: 

> The revolution was unusual for the surprise it created throughout the world: it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution, occurred in a nation that was enjoying relative prosperity, produced profound change at great speed, was massively popular, resulted in the exile of many Iranians. [Wikipedia: Iranian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution). 

Of course, we always must be *driven* by *something*. If one regime falls, then if another regime has to follow up, then it should at least be a better one (something more solid that we can hold on) than the one we had before, and it is better to stick to the old if we never attempt work on the new that we prophesize. In a similar manner, the theory of Mental Symmetry is at a stage that needs to be worked on. In a matter of fact, Mental Symmetry may bring the original true colors of what a “King of King” actually means. Mental Symmetry can become a universal principle that will create a common ground despite our differences of our religion and culture we have. It will be just like obliterating the monarchy in Iran, but in a bigger magnitude like the scientific revolution did in the past. However, we are not attempting here like others do saying: 

> "All aboard on the plane!" (while the plane was not yet built)

When the plane is not already physically there in the first place, how can you believe those words when our actions do not match with our statement? Instead, if my airplane[**1**] represents a specific form of a general theory driven by our own specific obsession, then my main message at this point is: 

> Do you want to build an airplane? There are chances it will fail. But you should not worry about the pitfalls that it will involve. Here are the prototype of the blueprints. I may be working on this all alone. Do you want to build an airplane? Do you want to build an airplane?

### Using NLP to understand the domains of others.

What happens when our obsessions are different from others and we cannot find a common ground? Well, NLP comes to the rescue. In a matter of fact, this technique may be what all psychologists use to understand others obsessions. There are other ways that we can understand the motivation of others by looking at the demographics by generation (Baby Boomers, Millennials, etc.), which the book Feedback Revolution provides in the second half part of the book, but that is almost the extreme generalisation of plotting a line which makes it no different than the line of being discriminatory. In order to make appropriate generalizations, we have to look many more factors and there is no better way of doing that effectively other by knowing the process of NLP, which untangles the source of our beliefs for every person. Actually, using that technique of observing others and analyzing their point of view in order for us to respond appropriately (A common Facilitator strategy), can lead you the ability to have the most acquaintances possible.

The bad news is that our world is becoming more specialized than ever career wise with multiple certifications, degrees, and *specific* experiences at hand that makes the world more divided in their own little small domains. Do you remember on our previous weekly module that we discussed how our visual input can trap us if we don't understand the common sense abstractions that are behind? Well NLP is the one that takes care about that. We discussed Natural Language Processing (NLP) before by recommending the book *Clean Language by Judy Rees* so we are not going to cover the contents of what NLP is all about in here. We are going to discuss though what happens when people do not use NLP, hoping that encourages and motivates people to start to understand the motivations of others instead of only just looking the things at the surface, as that may blind us to the real truth. Briefly, there are two bad things that happen when domains have a conflict of interest:

* People will not give feedback and convert it instead to short talk (i.e. if a Doctor makes a mistake, he will short talk it instead of getting feedback because his domain of making the least mistakes becomes more important than saving as many people possible. When that happens, the original foundation of a common domain collapses). 
* People will blame others, turning people that courageously did something as best as they could to have the less courage to do so due to the persecution, making them less "active" in learning by doing. In other words, blaming blocks the origin intention of feedback, which was making people learn on their own by their own doing on how to fix those mistakes. As discussed before, blaming others is following a road to unrighteousness as we don’t leave them to hold on something that they only have, leaving them with nothing as they are not yet prepared to hold anything else beyond that.

Those two problems will be explained at our last weekly module of this tour by going through the book *Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed*. The scary truth is that not only careers are impacted in specific domains of interest, but also how our current general beliefs are formed as well. Read the article of ['Lost of the collective fantasy' by Jane X. Wang](http://www.janexwang.com/blog/lost-in-collective-fantasy) which discusses the problem in detail. Although her solution for placing a peer review system of readings between noise and signal can help us (in a similar way how Norton identifies whether a file should be trusted or not), let us remember why high paying job interviews give boring mundane exercises that require critical thinking. This peer review system would make sense for people who are passive in critical thinking, but we want more importantly a society that encourages critical thinking. Creating a platform that embraces people to use critical thinking should be one of the top priorities. Otherwise, anybody who would lack critical thinking would label this self development booster mental map tour unfamiliar or even controversial as they would not do any proper research to investigate and understand the provided sources.

## Conclusion

That wraps up for this weekend module. For a summary of what we learn about feedback from the book *Feedback Revolution by Peter McLaughlin*, as well some of its missing drawbacks we wish they were there, let us reiterate: Overall a great practical book on learning the basics of giving feedback properly to others. However, would be nice if it provided a general process of understanding others we are not familiar with, such as NLP. In case you missed my review of the book last time, [take a read](https://github.com/softdevlife/contributed_articles/blob/master/book_reviews/feedback_revolution.md):
