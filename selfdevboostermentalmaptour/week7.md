# Introduction to Mental Networks & Neural Networks

There is a saying that an *image is a thousand words*. That does not mean that an image for a person can convey a thousand words (We instead filter things with the use of our [attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention)). What it actually means is that an image can convey a different meaning for each person, summing up all the answer variations to be more than a thousand words. 

What that specifically means is that every person creates their own framework. That framework, as we will see later, is stored as [**Mental Networks**](http://www.mentalsymmetry.com/mentalnetwork.php). The abstract ones are stored in the **Teacher Cognitive Module** living in the `analytic region`(also termed as `sequential`) while the concrete ones are stored in **Mercy Cognitive Module** living in the `associative region`. **Mental networks** can be described as small software running in an operating system that stores programs that are beyond the basic ones that keep the mind and body operating. The form's nature of those networks (abstract or concrete) emanates them to be very distinct from each other. We will discuss and learn more later about the nature of **Teacher Mental Networks** (TMN for short) and **Mercy Mental Networks** (MMN for short) between [Thomas Kuhn Scientific Revolution Notes](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/Kuhn.html) / [Black Box Thinking By Matthew Syed](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Thinking-People-Mistakes-But/dp/1591848229) and [The Power of Habit By Charles Duhhig](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X). When we go over these books, we will learn: 
* TMN are a derived product input of MMN.
* TMN look at the big picture and make hypothesis/generalizations/theories
* Because TMN are abstract (also termed as the `hidden layer`), they can not be conceptualized or understood without MMN examples.
* TMN are very few in nature and more prone for people to be trapped by them (also termed as `fixed mindset`). It is harder to find substitutes and takes more effort due to its indirect nature.
* MMN come from a form of input. Their triggers are more direct than the ones from TMN.
* MMN are easy to substitute to existing triggers with different ones that produce the same satisfaction (also simplified termed as `habits`)
* MMN by default are very easy to be influenced by nature, unless controlled by TMN (which for most individuals those can represent `values`)

Our values (also termed as `framework` or `mental map`) are symbolic (abstract) and retain in Teacher Cognitive module as TMN. Language is also symbolic and that is how we express our values. For instance, artificial intelligence uses NLP to identify vagueness within words that exist in phrases and metaphors within our common dialogue. **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) is a tool that did a good job helping people conceptualize intuitively the fact that each person runs different programs morphed by different factors from the environment. We always see the world through some lens of glasses that can be different from others, as described in *Thomas Kuhn Scientific Revolutions*:

>What occurs during a scientific revolution is not fully reducible to a reinterpretation of individual and stable data. In the first place, the data are not unequivocally stable. A pendulum is not a falling stone, nor is oxygen dephlogisticated air. Consequently, the data that scientists collect from these diverse objects are, as we shall shortly see, themselves different. More important, the process by which either the individual or the community makes the transition from constrained fall to the pendulum or from dephlogisticated air to oxygen is not one that resembles interpretation. How could it do so in the absence of fixed data for the scientist to interpret? Rather than being an interpreter, the scientist who embraces a new paradigm is like the man wearing inverting lenses. (pp.121-122)

What TMN and MMN content we want to fill our mind are up to us and non-deterministic if looked at an individual level, but the process of how TMN and MMN are formed can be conceptualized. A prescription (also termed as a `methodology`) is like a [shadow in Plato's cave](https://github.com/softdevlife/contributed_articles/blob/master/comments/allegoryofthecave.md). What is important instead is how those shadows are formed behind our existing mode of consciousness (also termed as meta-thinking). For that reason, applying meta-thinking materials like NLP and the rest of the concepts of Mental Symmetry are principles that will impact our life for the better, have a better direction, as well reducing any miscommunication and misunderstandings.

*The content of Mental Networks can be represented like the shadows in Plato's Allegory of the cave. The shadows itself does not give us much clues about the meaning of life, as much as the source behind how those shadows are constructed.*

Mental networks may have a lot of associations with **Neural Networks** in machine learning because the discipline of data science also investigates how the brain works. **Input X** represent MMN, the **hidden layer** as Perceiver and Teacher modules composing TMN of **F(X)**, and the **output Y** representing the Server module. The Y within F(X) can be passed back as a new input (also termed as a `training set`) to formulate a better theory, creating a constant loop termed as `Bayesian inference`. For more info about Bayesian thinking, you can find how a famous poker star won by using **Bayesian Thinking in Chapter 6 Decision Making on Smarter, Faster, Better by Charles Duhhig**.

## Next Week Module
We will use this material on our next week module to discuss the three types of learning that I learned as a **Math Tutor In San Diego City College** (also well documented in Cognitive Science): Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic.
