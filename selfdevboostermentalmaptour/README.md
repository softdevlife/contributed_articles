## Welcome To The Grand Tour About Yourself

The blog [softwaredeveloperlife](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/) is celebrating its three year anniversary. The blog started [all out of a dream](https://softwaredeveloperlife.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-nothing-person-thursday-person-friday.html). Personal draft papers were held. Each paper had its own story. Stories that were not cultivated, not spread, not in books or having a glimpse into our concrete world. These are fragile papers that can be torn apart from existing stronger obsessions manifesting within our society:

> **\<While standing\><br>**
> This work is very rewarding and challenging at the same time. But not all people can work on this type of job. Some people excel at what they do while some other do adequately fine. Some people are Thursdays, some people are Fridays. Either way, they are both useful, but it is what Friday people make the most value for our company.
> **<br>\<When sitting down\><br>**
> But you see, what does it need to take to become a Friday person or even a Thursday person to some degree? Well, you have a lot of other papers like these lying around: Your relatives, your other revolutionary ideas, meetings, and other stuff that seem important to you but at the sacrifice of your work performance. Well these papers...
> **<br>\<Tears those papers\><br>**
> Are a big distraction for becoming a Friday Person. Maybe not so much for a Thursday person, but definitely for a Friday Person.
> **<br>\<End of Dream\><br>**

If we haven't thought about our own desires twice, the obsessions others give us will force us to become Friday people, obsessed to their obsessions, not giving doubts whether their path given to us is right or wrong, as well not leaving any opportunity on evaluating our papers actual value before they get left behind for others to fold and take apart.

It is a time for self-reflection. We ultimately want to be Friday people. But are we being the correct Friday people? If not, should we let that Friday become a Thursday to focus on a better Friday?

I had a lot of papers on my hand. I had the choice to either ignore them all or pick one or two that I felt the most important and ditch what others told me what I should specifically do instead. One of the important papers is this blog that has manifested within the last three years. Before I started this blog, I already had new perspectives about the purpose of life. Most people observed the purpose of life as a duck, but to me, it already looked like a rabbit. But those perspectives were not warped solid and clear enough to me at that time. The rabbit still looked blurry to me because I didn't know much how the rabbit looked like in the first place. I really couldn't believe at that time when I started my blog that I would be transitioning from posting blog posts about my reactions to my personal experiences, to incorporating the theory of [mental symmetry](www.mentalsymmetry.com) with concepts derived from personal development and self-help books, to giving you a discussion on my weekly modules of **selfdevboostermentalmaptour** about Psychology, Philosophy, and the Bible.

I have to thank the Internet for stumbling me one day on the pages of Lorin and Lane Friesen discussing the seven cognitive styles. But most importantly of all, I want to thank myself, from among external pressure and adversity, I still endured having the courage and persistence to rediscover the old ruins of theology, bringing the purpose of life back to its true colors.

>Listen to my story.<br>
>This may be our last chance.<br> 
>To save our own self.
