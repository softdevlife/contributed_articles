We want people to be better human actors in our society.

0:04
We want people to accept and rely on solid facts.

0:10
We should not let our emotions get in the way. As Kevin Simler, in the article "Crony Beliefs" states:

0:18
"But perhaps the biggest hallmark of epistemic cronyism is exhibiting strong emotions,"

0:25
"as when we feel proud of a belief, anguish over changing our minds, or anger at being challenged or criticized."

0:33
Furthermore, our inductions should focus on looking at the big picture

0:39
instead of doing quick generalizations out of our own imagination that is limited to our own views.

0:46
This is remarked by the book Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed as cognitive dissonance.

0:52
What happens when a cult finds out that the deadline of the apocalypse

0:58
that would come in a form of a spaceship would pass away?

1:02
Well, their imagination will stunt you. Quoting from the book:

1:06
"As Festinger recounts in his classic book When Prophecy Fails, 14 they simply redefined the failure."

1:13
‘The godlike figure is so impressed with our faith that he has decided to give the planet a second chance’ they proclaimed

1:21
(I am paraphrasing only a little). ‘We saved the world!’

1:26
"Far from abandoning the cult, core members went out on a recruitment drive. As Festinger put it:"

1:33
‘The little group, sitting all night long, had spread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction.’

1:40
They were ‘jubilant’

1:43
Lastly, we should not be stuck with our own ideologies.

1:51
Instead, we need to put them into action and test them out whether they work or not.

1:57
As Mark Zuckerberg speech at North Carolina A&T State University states:

2:03
"what you do is just don't buy into this myth that you need to have an idea fully formed"

2:10
"or something fully formed before you get started, that is dangerous and it will stop you from getting started"

2:17
"and just diving in and knowing that you're going to learn along the way actually is how things get done in the world"

2:24
I envision of a society with better human actors.

2:29
A software that improves peoples' psychological problems.

2:34
A social network where not people only "like" others' profiles,

2:39
but reach out and give advice on the personal problems others are going through.

2:44
A meeting site where people want to make meaningful long-term relationships by their hobbies and skills.

2:51
However, I think this may not be the greatest timing for people being prepared on that quest.

2:57
People will usually won't don't do something good (for just the sake of it).

3:04
People will usually do something by an expectation of a concrete reward.

3:12
They need a reward for doing something, right?

3:15
Conclusively, people will find psychological help only when it already becomes too bad.

3:23
People will not be the best role models on helping others or have a deep interest in sharing their own hobbies and skills.

3:32
Before they can manage and help others, they first need to know how they can manage their own self.

3:44
Therefore, we can improve humans be better actors of themselves

3:49
by managing their resources and health with financial and health tracking software.

3:55
It should be simple, effective like how we share our individual experiences in social networks

4:00
and communicate with others through messengers.

4:04
and this should be simple, effective and widespread like how we use our social networks and messengers

4:30
Sorry, one second, being honest, I am reading my notes, it makes me you know (more organized)

4:42
oh man, hehe

4:55
Financial and Health Technology will become an enabler for managing our resources and health.

5:02
Managing our health and our resources better will become a cornerstone habit

5:09
for people being more proactive on their psychological problems,

5:13
being better role models on helping others,

5:15
as well having an interest in the skills and the hobbies of others.

5:20
It will be an intermediate step that will help humans be better models of society.

5:25
So let us make FinTech and Healh Tech as one of our main priorities within our society.

5:32
Thank you
