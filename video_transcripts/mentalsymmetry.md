Hi, so today, I am going to talk about the way of my own thinking

0:12
This is a description of how I reached up to this point

0:22
of having faith with mental symmetry

0:29
And it (the actions of I how reached there) is kind of related to my blog

0:34
So, we, as humans, go into different types of stages

0:47
As we go, like I go (on the time I was) as a child

0:52
I start (my thinking expresses mostly) with some raw experiences

0:56
I really (at that stage) not able to correlate much of what is happening around me

1:05
You are starting (later) to have some type of consciousness, able to have your own type of (richer) character

1:14
of making, your own choices (independent of environment), once you start going to school

1:22
I mean your character (has) more volition, more ways to manipulate the stuff (the content within your mind)

1:38
you have then a sense of more freedom when you are able to make things sense out of the world

1:49
But the problem is that we still focus a lot on concrete experiences

2:00
on the subjective part

2:02
go to something objective like science and other stuff and you know

2:07
you have science with theoretical theories where they touch the topic of the abstract

2:16
And they are in some sense, have a form, of a platonic form attitude on seeing things

2:32
There is really a strong emotions on those stuff

2:40
like Thomas Kuhn Scientific Revolutions, the book really describes how people become very emotional

2:49
on their beliefs

2:54
And there is another emotion, which is concrete experiences

3:00
We think that the subjective part is only by concrete experiences

3:05
But here I am trying to say that it is not

3:12
It can also be applied in a theoretical way

3:16
A lot of the philosophies of our works have done that well like Immanuel Kant categorical imperative

3:24
But some others we did, they were total failures, that reached to tragic dead ends on our humanity and even world wars due to that

3:39
But that is another topic, but (all this) is just an introduction to say

3:45
Maybe we should pay attention about the subjective part of our own self

3:51
And that is kind of the total mission out of this (journey), the total mission out of this is on that, on this video that I am talking (which will describe how it reaches closer to the mission)

4:01
And also my way of thinking (which it tries as much as it can to align on that mission)

4:06
And I think it is as Thomas Kuhn have said (this mission is best assigned as) a new paradigm

4:12
its a paradigm shift

4:14
some (paradigms) are very small (low impact) that follow the same domain

4:19
and this one I think its very big cause it touches the subjective part

4:23
the subjective part is harder to tackle than the objective part because it represents "me"

4:29
it will have pain to accept of "maybe there is a better way to do better things in our life, but maybe I don't want to because I prefer to do the most benefit out of my own self (limited domain)"

4:44
This is one of the challenging parts because if then we go to (compare) with Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, (we would in the current paradigm) said

4:55
(society or the current methodology) follows a different paradigm than your own then you know it will not work

5:02
(As a result) you cannot see the benefits out of it

5:06
The point is when there is a paradigm shift (in its initial stages), you cannot see (instantly) the benefits

5:14
When you try to start on such idea, people will think that you are crazy

5:17
The point is the computer industry, the way how it exploded, there were a lot of people that when they started (on such journey), (the rest of the) people felt they were crazy, maybe they were like witches or something

5:34
(their crazy attitude was attributed) because they tried to do something with a lot of passion

5:39
but nobody could see the results of what they did (in the starting stages), it took them a lot of years and a lot of stages to reach that stage

5:48
to gain that recognition.

5:51
Anybody (who) would go to such path (and) if you had to be passionate, you (better) have a good idea that will work later

6:02
but (its fine as long as you are sure that) maybe it will not work now

6:04
It has to be in the form of a potential candidate to do a paradigm shift

6:15
Here we have mental symmetry as a contestant (that I try to bring it to life)

6:25
One of the things about mental symmetry is that if somebody (wants to figure out what this theory) really tackles on

6:35
it really tries to do rational stuff on the subjective

6:39
and (the result for people who go on this journey) is really painful and it really takes a lot of time (as it tries to resolve our immorality)

6:44
there is no gimmicks here, we try to do it by comparing different philosophers, different (self help) books, there is an effort, okay?

6:52
And we are doing it (in such a way that conclusively), ironically, if you guys don't want to believe it, we are (explicitly) doing it in a scientific way, okay?

6:58
The point is nobody really wants to debate or argue about it

7:03
Its more like we treat it as an apophatic way

7:06
And the point is, it requires really (actual) critical thinking

7:13
critical thinking not on the objective, but on the subjective

7:20
the (first) point here is a really troubling challenge for anybody to tackle on this thing (because of the attitude of people who reject scientific thought on the subjective)

7:40
For current society, they will think that this is a crazy idea (read chapter 4 of natural cognitive theology for understanding the reason it is in denial)

7:46
The second part is that it is very challenging (to grasp) and it is very hard, it really requires more mental effort than objective stuff.

7:53
I can just tell (by my own experience), that is why I am posting this video, my own experiences, right here

7:59
about my own way of thinking of how I reached here so far

8:06
I have a really high GPA on my grades on my university

8:14
I was able to excel on all of them

8:16
those (achievements are) categorizes as objective rational tasks

8:18
Also in my job (all careers after my graduation), I did a lot of stuff smoothly

8:22
And that is also completing objective rational tasks

8:26
I still (find those tasks) as a little challenge, not because they are very hard (the average person can compete me better at it)

8:32
That (objective rational thought) is not my total passion as much the subjective rational thought

8:39
And the subjective rational thought, in order to really grasp it and to really to reach to that stage where you are motivated to do (deeds related to) that stuff (in other words, faith)

8:47
You really need a very high degree of passion more than you can imagine

8:52
Because the tackle (obstacles) of the subjective rational are total amounts more harder than the objective rational tasks

9:05
(where objective rational tasks) require the least action to create new products that help society, but not in the subjective part

9:21
It needs deliberate practice, regular (continuous mental) exercise on that (subjective rational thought), it really uses a lot of your stamina on your brain

9:32
it is not a thing where you can tackle it on a day or two

9:36
you have to take this and read this more like the albatross

9:40
Its one of the biggest challenges, its more like reading one of those weird languages (i.e. Haskell - but it is not weird if you live in that paradigm)

9:53
I think you get my point

9:55
That is like a forewarning about it if you try to dive in the journey of mental symmetry

10:07
then you know why (you feel) it doesn't work out (if you place wrong expectations about it)

10:10
So I started this journey 10 years ago and how I want to describe it (on the first time I saw it)

10:19
"I just read it, I skimmed it, okay, yeah (it looks cool)"

10:23
So (I am going to describe here) how I looked at it with my own way of thinking

10:31
maybe there are other paths (to get the same results), but I can just tell you (my own sample) on how to think about it

10:35
One of the chapters that are very good in natural cognitive theology book of Lorin Friesen

10:42
is you know, chapter 5, education

10:44
And most likely that is the path you have to do

10:52
you have to do rote learning, memorize the stuff, then you correlate it, and then you have confidence on that

10:59
So I think that is one of the paths in order to get faith

11:04
Lorin Friesen correlated (his theory of mental symmetry) with the bible

11:09
You don't need to correlate it (at start) until you have faith on it

11:14
So we have to take it independently regardless if its on the bible or not, whether (affiliated with) religion

11:20
So why should we put (in the end) on the emphasis of the bible

11:23
Well, we say, "what if". "What if" this is a simulation and our goal as being subjects of machine learners is to reach to our ultimate state, on characters that compliment harmoniously on the whole system that we live in

11:41
Probably, it could have been done by our own self alone (without the option of there being a bible)

11:47
or there is some guide for us to reach that goal

11:52
The point is if I created an artificial intelligence machine

12:00
That artificial intelligence has to go through machine learning to reach its ultimate state

12:06
What should its focus be?

12:08
To focus upon "me", the creator?

12:11
Or should the focus be (for the AI) how this computer works inside (especially its own self code) so it can reach to its ultimate state

12:17
What (me as the creator, out of those two options), would I wanted for the artificial intelligence to do?

12:21
(AI to) read (the instructions) of the latter part, focus on (its own self) machine.

12:25
Maybe (me as a creator) I also give a guide there, you know, like a book.

12:28
That what Lorin Friesen implicates is that the bible is like (a book that has a) guide like that

12:34
That is (mostly) and nothing else

12:36
what we are trying to do here (if we wanted to associate the bible with this theory)

12:37
nothing else (no hocus pocus or pink unicorns, okay?)

12:48
So (lets repeat) again: Rote learning, evaluates facts, and then gain faith, that is one of the paths.

12:58
That is actually the best path

13:00
I don't know if there is any other (in terms of a faith that can form platonic forms that can be applied everywhere like scientific formulas with no exceptions)

13:02
But you do that (path to reach faith), then what it becomes (at the end of the path) is ideas like in the objective realm

13:14
(think of) ideas, few people, agree on those ideas, they create a start up, then they become the founders, they have a strong passion

13:21
but in the real world, in the real external world, these ideas has doubts (get tested on the water) whether it will really work or not.

13:30
(Mental symmetry after faith) can be like a start up idea where it can fail or succeed, okay?

13:33
In the same vein here, you have to create deeds, actions that resemble on that idea.

13:40
And if the results are positive instead of negative, then the start up idea becomes a big conglomerate nation

13:49
so that is the concept of the second part (after faith is done internally, you have to apply it externally)

13:54
My first part is faith, but the second part is also creating deeds that resemble, that this can reflect to the whole world

14:13
Based on (understanding how faith works), I want to say that I used to read the (first version of the) book of lorin friesen 3-4 years ago

14:21
I just read some part up to a point and then I stopped, I didn't read all of it, okay?

14:27
The mind doesn't really (swallows stuff that easily), it has doubts, okay?

14:33
What you do is try to correlate evidence (related to the theory) in order to get faith

14:39
In order to have faith, you have to correlate evidence by other sources of books and see if it matches

14:45
And if it (the sources) matches, and also based on your (personal) experiences, they both match

14:49
then you have faith on it because you do it (in your mind strategically) not by something (i.e. a playbook that is) shallow, fluffy, out of because somebody else said it.

14:57
But because you tried it by your own efforts to evaluate whether it is true or not.

15:01
And now I am reading the new book (second version of natural cognitive theology) again, okay?

15:06
I haven't read the whole book (yet), its a very big book

15:11
But this time, when I am reading it, I am really confident that this book has the truth (I see it in "new lenses")

15:16
Instead of having doubts about it, along (another) point is we have very limited time in our life (and we don't want to re-invent the wheel)

15:23
So there is up to a point where we have confidence on something (take the plug out)

15:28
the author, you have to trust the author in some sense (as in the same way the same author trusts the bible)

15:35
From the background of the author of how he does things, he doesn't look for pride, he looks at things

15:44
to do his own research for seeking the truth and nothing else, he doesn't has a methodology (of normal science) that he embraces

15:54
and that is like one of the great things: they can always make mistakes, but you know that path (of explaining the truth) is more accurate than someone else that follows (normal science) methodology

16:10
and that is why I trust this author

16:12
And after that, (after) I read the whole book, what I really want, is to officially graduate

16:22
Officially graduate from critical thinking on the subjective parts, because we as people, our college degree or university degree only graduates us on the objective stuff in most cases and not on the subjective stuff.

16:35
So this is like a really graduation that we also (should) do in some sense or part.

16:41
And (after that, my journey is to) do correlated actions to mental symmetry that (will) help our world

16:47
One of the ideas was create a social network. I created a prototype of the social network (which you can find on my blog)

16:54
The other (idea) is maybe just create a course that analyzes some of the topics (within mental symmetry) in the context of social networks and other products

17:10
Its creating insights so they can be used for making more richer products (that are derived from mental symmetry)

17:17
All the great stuff that we create (in the end) is based (firstly) by learning, create a community where other people are interested and then it grows and it grows (see how Haskell does that)

17:26
I think (mental symmetry) should follow that path as well

17:35
What I can only talk about is only the first part (how I reached to the point of having faith)

17:40
That is my part of my journey (that I have completed so far) and I am a use case here, I am the guinea pig, that is why I post all the blog posts (of my journey)

17:46
So everybody knows how the way of my thinking has reached up to this point

17:56
Most likely I am the average person (use case) of trying to learn mental symmetry, while it has different other struggles in his life

18:06
like you know work life balance, then you have relationships, and then you have other stuff, maybe sometimes you don't have clear mind because of minor health issues over time, and so on.

18:20
The first point I want to say is I started this as a teenager, I read it, I skimmed it a little bit, and then (as an adult) after some experiences in my workplace

18:35
I was able to analyze (my workplace environment with) mental symmetry

18:42
I always up to 4 to 5 years (after I first encountered mental symmetry), just study (mental symmetry) and say:

18:51
"yeah, that follows a pattern with mental symmetry"

19:00
But that (action) really doesn't leaps to the next step of having faith on it just by (doing just that and the rest of your conscious life is) being idle (about it)

19:07
So analyzing is kind of important, of your own experiences

19:12
The second part (to gain faith is) correlating other sources to this theory

19:17
And if they match, then you have more faith on it.

19:20
And the books like black box thinking, executive paradox, revolutionary feedback, and I (also) skimmed a little bit the (book of) clean language

19:31
and they all resemble most part of mental symmetry

19:40
The biggest challenge I think is how to go from point A (no faith) to point B (having faith)

19:50
and like I said, one of the requirements is hard work, determination, (acknowledging that) its not an easy thing to do as I said in my introduction

19:57
Its really like a sport where we have to exercise our body and then try to do some practice matches and then you will be more confident to play the real games of the world

20:15
And the same in here (in this mission), the mental brain its not only about practicing the brain to gain the correct cognitive ability to do things fast

20:24
But also have a strategy that can match (and) adapt to our subjective mind

20:32
Most of it (right now on how the world uses the brain) is only limited to the objective mind. The full game is the subjective mind people.

20:45
(So in conclusion and my advice on this journey is) one, to try to put in your brain (by using rote learning) and (later have the a-ha moments and) say "oh there is patterns"

20:51
Then you try to analyze it (this theory) by experiences

20:53
and then correlating with sources (i.e. books, research) that match with mental symmetry

20:58
and then you gain more faith (where at some point you will become completely faithful like a founder)

21:00
And how I came to that conclusion? Well the author actually did the same thing, okay?

21:05
So he had some old articles (which at that time were his latest when I was reading them) at his young age, he used to write articles analyzing subjects (with mental symmetry).

21:12
So I did the same (as my first blog posts follow a similar format)

21:15
Then he also tried in his last years to correlate with other sources of books

21:19
I did the same

21:20
I saw his (works) over the years where (over time) he improved his theory, that he had more faith on it, and I got also the same results out of it.

21:30
So thats I think the strategy

21:36
So what I really recommend is look at mental symmetry only by the cognitive modules first (I posted some links that can help you on that on video description bellow)

21:43
Understand how its cognitive modules works

21:47
The other thing is, yeah, maybe you can look at it a personality level (from my experience, it really helps tremendously when starting out)

21:55
But I think mental symmetry, the whole purpose is not about personality level, as much as how it can integrate into the way of our thinking on all aspects of things as a theory.

22:08
That is how the strategy of a machine learner works, and so on.

22:17
Personality exists of course

22:22
We have created (in the past and currently) a lot of theories about personality, so then cognitively, mental symmetry must resemble in some way that each person has a specific personality

22:32
The other thing is (on the topic of) different sexes, a lot of research has shown that each sex the way it acts is different in order to get the same result

22:49
Like the mind operates in a different way in order to get the same results

22:52
Then we can say some part of the cognitive modules are more active on one gender compared to the other (and vice versa)

23:03
We have seen that anatomically, physically, that you know, some of the brain regions are bigger than the others

23:09
This is pretty math and we have to try to investigate and understand that instead of being in denial about it.

23:19
Like I said there are a lot of challenges to it

23:24
Like black box thinking describes (watch my black box thinking video if you haven't watched it yet)

23:27
And people don't want to tackle on the subjective part

23:33
So (to summarize), here I talked about cognitive modules, just really focusing on those, try to understand (to see) how each one works

23:45
try to understand the strategy of how a (usual) plan is worked out, okay? (Exhorter->Contributor->Facilitator)

23:52
It really takes a lot of time to grasp those

23:56
The next thing is get other concepts that describes mental symmetry, like mental networks (which are the representation of concrete and abstract habits)

24:03
Then, (try to find out) the correct strategy of doing things: (For instance,) teacher mental networks are more important than mercy mental networks

24:13
(Doing all those tasks) requires a lot of initiative. If you don't have initiative and you don't have a sense to investigate or use critical thinking, then you lose the battle (of making the teacher mental network of mental symmetry active) immediately.

24:30
I know that this is a paradigm (where the rest will look at it as having) crazy ideas

24:38
Its like you know, Steve Jobs, where he had so much passion about that new (prototype) computer (Lisa) that everybody wanted to dismiss it.

24:47
Here we are again on the subjective part (by being rational as a new paradigm with mental symmetry)

24:52
This is a new domain and people will just reject it, but here I am, I have passion, I think others (can eventually get the same) passion

25:00
And I think if people understand the way of thinking of it (mental symmetry)

25:09
and they experience it (the effects of mental symmetry, such as being faith on it), of course it will contradict with current society

25:16
But if it has good lasting benefits like other philosophical works, and so on.

25:21
Then, the point is, (the problem is that) people are afraid, they don't know whether this will be good or bad

25:31
But, you know, it will be either one of those two, it may have chances that this is not bad

25:37
And I always want to peer review with others or collaborate or make arguments about it, to discuss about it

25:48
(To find out with confidence) whether this will be positive or negative

25:50
I have hopes all of it is to be positive. At the same time, the nice thing about (mental symmetry is having the component of) critical thinking

26:05
(critical thinking allows us) to choose a belief out of our own self. I am not going to force others, it is a thing to contemplate or think of the way of thinking

26:15
(Mental symmetry plays the same rules as scientific objective thought, but in subjective terms). It is more like a start up idea. If we are not ready there yet, maybe we have to think other steps to reach where we can be ready for it.

26:27
So thanks for watching and that was about how the way of thinking I have reached up to (the point of) having faith on mental symmetry

26:38
And I really wanted to discuss about that and I hope its more comprehensible (how this journey goes).

26:46
Thanks for watching
