0:00
Ok, so today, I am going to talk about black box thinking

0:06
by Matthew Syed and we have a lot of topics to discuss

0:11
so it will be kind of slow paced so you have to bear with me

0:17
as it will take a lot of time. So I guess maybe you guys may have

0:22
not understand what this is all about.

0:24
What the hell is black box thinking?

0:29
So in order to illustrate that as an example so you guys are more familiar with it

0:35
Lets say you know two guests go inside a bar and one buys a glass of water and another buys a coconut water.

0:45
And lets say they finish the drinks and then the waiter comes and

0:50
you know, the waiter can tell that the glass of water is done, but you know the coconut water is very hard to tell

0:57
because it is a "real" physical coconut water, so the waiter cannot tell whether its done or not, so

1:05
a black box can "represent" a coconut water where you cannot see what is inside

1:11
Another example can be like an account balance. You may know your account balance, but you may not know your other's acquaintance bank account balance

1:21
So you may know, give you an errands to do and other stuff, and you know, may be, like you know

1:29
very hard to ask her bank account balance, maybe you know, she wants to suppress it or maybe she gives you a

1:41
fake number so she looks good and you don't have to worry

1:45
so the most straightforward way is to use that bank acount (card) on every physical store until

1:50
one store declines that credit card

1:53
so you know, that example sounds outrageous, and I am just giving that example only for illustration purposes

2:03
because who would really want to know someone's else bank account balance?

2:09
but in other cases, where we need to know the information to make our society better

2:16
then it is quite important to know someone's information

2:24
and it is not very straightforward, because doing it in a straightforward way like in the example before

2:30
it is kind of inappropriate and also even illegal, so the only way to get that information is by

2:37
the individual itself to express the truth

2:41
so now that we understand in some way what black box is

2:47
we have to see, like, how the black box in today's society

2:52
so if we have to represent a black box in today's society, then we have to treat it like a pandora box

2:59
Why? Ok, yeah, pandora box, yes, that mythological box, like in those movies we have seen

3:06
They open and through their lenses of their perception, they all see is something dark or very gloomy

3:12
you know, not very nice to see or to say

3:17
so how do I came to that conclusion? Well, it is very obvious, that, you know

3:22
society, as a way, we create norms through each individual

3:29
whether that is really a person or an organization, some norms, to protect some information, you know,

3:37
(that can) pop up, so they hide them, like a coconut water

3:41
So that happens... Examples (that demonstrate that)

3:47
Companies try to create norms to hide information in order to avoid costs

3:53
They have a lot of expectations, like, if its also publicly traded

4:01
like companies with (that have to report) estimated revenues and other stuff

4:05
if you if it goes down (bellow expectations), a lot of people will get fired, because the stock goes down

4:12
they cannot have enough funds to meet the demands that they could before.

4:17
Health industries have a lot of costs, like you know, its very expensive for them

4:22
They (usually or most of them) focus on costs and when you only focus on cost you only care more about

4:31
your own company instead of being social responsible, you don't look at the big picture of things.

4:36
Those norms can be examples like , in order to try to hide some stuff, people give for instance

4:47
severance packages to employees so the (employees must) hide some information so they don't lawsuit them

4:52
or something like that. Another very big thing is the norms that we put on interviews, you know

5:00
Interviews, like individuals that have to go (through that process), they have to focus only on their strengths

5:05
That is a way that the information that we hide is so outrageous

5:14
that I don't know how like individuals can improve themselves by using such norms

5:20
but it is not any other way they can get career opportunities otherwise.

5:29
Lets look at that matter, you know

5:32
If the individual did a bad public stunt or did a mistake the whole wide company knows about

5:40
like bad credit score and other stuff, then the employee has like little to no chances to have any

5:47
good or great career opportunities to himself, because we as a society we attribute anything negative

5:53
as a dead end for them, in the same way (we treat) organizations (that perform badly)

5:57
because of that, people have to hide that information, they have to focus only on their strengths

6:06
and that is one of the biggest challenges (hiding stuff)

6:11
Even companies, on their respect, I just figured recently

6:18
that they also don't want to give feedback back to

6:22
because they don't know if their procedures are really the most effective ones (so they have to hide them)

6:26
both channels are really, not giving feedback, really sincere feedback to each other

6:34
and their only focus is on their strengths

6:39
Even if we go more into detail (of this case), employers will not give bad news about an employee

6:48
if he gets interviewed to another company, (or) former employees

6:51
because they know that if they give negative feedback then he will not get hired

6:57
they know how the structure of things (in society) works, how society treats some mistakes

7:03
as a mistake that (resembles) a dead end, we categorize them, they are like "junk", or we put them in categories

7:22
Instead of maybe they learned something from their mistakes and was part of their personal growth

7:30
Then we have "self-interest", okay?

7:34
This is a very competitive sport in criminal justice system, with lawyers that have to support their clients

7:40
that is totally amazing what happens there is the actual events they are either hidden and we will see later also

7:49
get twisted, if (that evidence) gets contested where every public person knows about that evidence

7:56
And the other thing is, a lot of roles, like C-level suite executives, doctors, pilots, lawyers, and others

8:05
we have high expectations on their roles, because of that high expectations, people on those roles

8:14
want to have a "clean sheet" where they don't (try) get a mistake in the future or did something in the past,

8:20
they just try to hide it

8:21
We will see hiding that information makes our society a less better place

8:29
So we go to our first example

8:33
That first example is the airplane industry, okay?

8:39
So there was one airplane industry that was (called) united airlines

8:43
On United Airlines, what the problem is, it went from New York to Oregon, I am not confident (of the route)

8:52
it usually takes 2 hours and 30 minutes, and it had a problem, with the landing gears

8:57
so to be more precise about that, the problem of that airplane incident had only 10 casualties (10 died).

9:08
But the other two airplanes, had the same issue (the landing gears), and they had more casualties than

9:17
the one we are going to discuss right now

9:20
one of them crashed in a mountain where all the passengers dead and another one

9:26
that one also hit on the everglades, and killed over 100 people

9:32
This one (that we are going to talk) only 10 people (died), then why are we talking about this one?

9:36
Because the black box inside that airplane transcribed the events of the conversation

9:43
which has the most (evidence), those conversations has the most evidence, to find out the reason why all those 3

9:50
airplanes crashed due to the landing gears.

9:57
The plane we are talking now, united airline, that plane, it took like 2 hours and 30 minutes to arrive (near) arrival

10:10
Everything was smooth (so far) and they put the landing gears (to drop) near the arrival of the airport

10:18
There were technical 2 problems when they turned on the landing gears.

10:25
One of them , there was a thud sound that reverberated all around the airplane

10:29
and all the passengers got scared and frustrated

10:33
and the other one was the lights of the landing gear were not shown up

10:40
so if the crew wanted to view on the windows, they would not able (see the landing gear lights) illuminating

10:48
We have like those 2 problems

10:54
the (airplane messaged) the air traffic control (about the problem), (and they got the approval) to do some circles

11:02
until you are able to figure out and solve that problem

11:04
25 minutes passed and another technical problem, the low fuel reserves of the airplane were low

11:16
so everybody knows basic elementary within airplane industries that if the fuel reserves are low

11:26
then it means that after 5 minutes, if you don't start landing your plane,

11:32
then the risks will be more devastating for every minute that the plane doesn't decide to land

11:38
so the crew told the captain, "the fuel reserves are low", okay? So he (the captain) didn't reply

11:48
5 (more) minutes passed. Still the pilot was focused on the landing gears.

11:54
the crew give him a second warning, "captain, the fuel reserves are low"

12:02
after 5 minutes, you know that the time is over (breaking point), you (either) land the plane now

12:09
or the consequences will become more severe for every minute that passes

12:16
but everybody was shocked when captain replied "What are you guys talking about? We have 15 minutes left"

12:22
That was not really the case, but the crew could not challenge the captain because at that time

12:35
on the airplane industry, the organization was hierarchical

12:40
Even if that answer was irrational, they had to follow the orders of the captain

12:45
Lets cut in here for a second and look at the captain's background, okay?

12:51
This captain's background had over 25 years of experience, veteran of WWII,

12:57
as a young child, he said to his mom, "hey I want to be a pilot", that was his dream

13:02
so how can he (the captain) avoid such elementary principles within the airplane industry?

13:07
So we have to look at it from his own views and perspectives, okay?

13:12
That pilot hide that information, that information, of you know, the fuel reserves.

13:26
Like I think the incident of the other 2 airplane incidents did the same thing.

13:29
Why? Because, if he landed the plane without the landing gears, the passengers would say:

13:39
"This pilot tried his best and he couldn't still find how to properly land the plane"

13:45
"He couldn't lower the landing gears and he was about to kill our life".

13:49
What would you think about that pilot future career would be? Would he still fly more planes?

13:56
Based on that event (if it happened), he didn't have a clean sheet, one of them was very bad news

14:03
the plane was screwed up with the landing gears. Will he still have a positive career?

14:10
Whether the fuel reserves are low or the landing gears were not there, it didn't matter to him (with the new info)

14:22
with the new situation of the low fuel reserves

14:27
Because either way he was still be blamed by landing a plane without the landing gears

14:34
But the most important at that situation, was yes, we have to land the plane without the landing gears

14:41
the "correct" theory in his mind should have been, which one of those technical problems has the highest priority

14:50
its the low fuel reserves, fix that first.

14:53
he didn't had that at his mind

14:55
15 minutes (more) passed and the plane was dropping 3000 feet per minute.

14:59
The captain was oblivious (to the situation) and he asked his crew, "what happened?"

15:06
the crew would say "the fuels are low"

15:09
So the captain didn't know what to say, he tried to land the plane, only 10 fatalities happened (10 dead)

15:20
Days later, the captain asked the private investigator that looked about the airplane incident

15:25
whether the fuel reserves had leaks.

15:28
So he was still stuck in his theory about landing gears (being the only problem during that flight)

15:33
We go to another example

15:38
This one (we just described) was on the individual level

15:41
Okay, lets go one on the organizational level, okay? So we go to the health industry, okay?

15:45
One hospital on Palo Alto, that one

15:50
healthcare industry is "oh my god"

15:53
the costs over the years have risen very high, they have very low budgets, so a lot of hospitals focus on costs

16:01
like I said before, that if you only focus on costs, then you may be adding business value to your organization

16:07
but you are less social responsible and in the long term you are not making a good plan to yourself.

16:14
So here we have the hospital of Palo Alto, (we have a case) where a mom had a daughter

16:20
which had some symptoms which can only be treated by inserting a central line

16:25
During a year, she was treated on that hospital, after lawsuits and litigation, they were found out that

16:33
that hospital used the central line four times in a bad (inappropriate) way where she got central line infection

16:40
everytime (she got an infection), she became weaker, then the next time some of her organs became weak,

16:46
at the end she got a virus and she died only within a year (after her first visit of that hospital)

16:51
Her mother tried to find why her daughter (died), what happened actually to her daughter (on that hospital)

16:58
the hospital gave an apology, they are (become) empathetic about her

17:08
but they don't give details more

17:12
studies suggest that if you say an apology letter or something like that, then there will be less likely that

17:20
the individual will lawsuit you. So the mother sued (the hospital) and even under litigation

17:27
the hospital didn't answer the details about what actually happened.

17:31
It had to be pushed to be found that there was 4 central line infections

17:38
The mother even said, even on her first letter before she filed a lawsuit

17:43
"I found out that one of your nurses touched the bed-rail (and she still used with the same gloves) to insert the central line"

18:01
Those were not (good) sanity ways (practices) and they didn't want to take responsibility

18:07
they didn't want to admit mistakes, because they cared about costs, to have the least costs

18:13
to not have any litigation, that way, they were not able to reduce the central line infections

18:20
Another hospital, accepted the mistake, okay?

18:30
They said, we have a guideline, we have a checklist, somebody monitors somebody that they follow all the procedures of every central line a nurse does

18:39
and what happened is in 3 months 50% of the central line infections were reduced and in 6 months by 70%

18:48
That was the Hopkins hospital

18:51
which identified the problem and tried to solve it

18:53
and now lets go to our previous case

19:00
which is the airplane industry

19:03
On the airplane industry, what do they do?

19:06
How did we got all that conversation that we heard?

19:09
They open the black box in the airplane which has all the conversation

19:14
The other thing, which its interesting is

19:16
We have also private investigators which have a mindset that does not have a motivation to hide information

19:29
like the pilot did

19:30
or in an organization, like the healthcare industry does

19:33
then they can have public reports where everybody can learn

19:38
Of course, the airplane carrier will get scrutinized, it will have less credibility

19:47
but that mistake that becomes transparent, everybody can learn so it does not happen again

19:54
A lot of times that landing gear happened often (before), but it did not happen often after they got all the events

20:00
the solutions they did was the pilot has to have a checklist to check every component is healthy

20:10
during an emergency situation like the fuel reserves

20:13
the other thing is the captain also learned some assertiveness to the passengers and crew

20:19
Next time a captain is motivated only by his own career, he will not do that because he knows

20:28
that the norms are more important than his "clean sheet" of record

20:32
and if he violates the norms, then he will have more consequences (to his self)

20:38
And that is how norms in an organization helps to create employees that you become better candidates

20:46
that are more social responsible rather than only (focusing) their line of career

20:54
So we are almost to an end (although the video shows we are halfway through)

20:58
I think most of you now will understand what black box thinking is

21:03
so here I have some paper here

21:08
now its clear

21:10
so here we have an individual that uses , that stuffs

21:17
in black box due to a motivation

21:20
okay? "This" (camera) is "horrible" but bear with me

21:24
This is my first try on this

21:27
Individual that stuffs a black box due to a motivation

21:34
now you "see"? Okay

21:36
Information that challenges a theory, okay?

21:40
where is my finger? okay

21:44
here we go: Information that challenges a theory

21:47
In this case can be like the central line infections or the low fuel reserves

21:53
and we try to "hide" it, okay

21:56
Now here we have public information that cannot be hidden

22:00
And we warp or twist that information to fit in

22:04
that is called cognitive dissonace

22:06
so in some cases, we always try to protect our theory, okay?

22:13
and our theory is "limited" (locked), okay?

22:16
So our theory is limited, its like you know, when people say they are too focused

22:23
it means that they are too "narrow" focused where they don't see the general picture

22:26
when they are not social responsible

22:30
so for instance, on the airplane industry, they were very narrow minded (the pilots) on their own career prospect

22:38
The health industry they only looked (themselves) from an organizational point

22:45
So the theory gets locked and that is a very big problem

22:49
But sometimes, like I said in here (in the diagram), evidence comes there, and you cannot hide it

22:56
it gets contested, everybody knows about it in the public

22:59
and now we are going to see one of them: the criminal justice system

23:03
Juan Rivera? I don't remember the name because I don't have it (the references) right here

23:10
He was convicted for rape, and he was an innocent guy, but he convicted for rape for 20 years.

23:21
He was forced to testify something that he didn't did, (and he testified from force) because he had a lot of psychological problems

23:33
And only by his testimony and no other evidence, he was convicted for first degree murder for a rape

23:41
So 15 years passed, that is an estimate, they found some evidence that the DNA did not match with

23:57
the person that they put in prison

23:59
the lawyers due to their self interest, to protect their face and also from the client end, to bring some justice

24:08
what they did with that evidence, (that showed proof) he did not did the rape

24:13
"oh okay", the lawyers could say, they tried (then) to twist the information to fit in the theory that still that guy

24:22
was the murderer of that rape

24:27
and they said "maybe somebody 'else' raped her and after he was done, then that guy (the defendant) opened the door and killed her"

24:36
so somebody "else" did that (rape), and after that, the next sequence, then he (the defendant) went there and he killed her

24:41
we see that situation is very less likely to happen

24:46
the only testimony they had one was that was really forced

24:50
that he testified, at that point, our legal system is to put somebody in jail when there is enough decisive evidence

25:08
so until proven, he is not guilty, you know?

25:10
so here we have less evidence to contest he is guilty and they twisted (the facts for their) theoretical story

25:19
he was still in jail (even with the DNA evidence)

25:21
That can also be attributed to judges where at evening times they may be more lenient or being more rational

25:35
but at morning times, they may not be very rational because they didn't got their lunch (yet) or something

25:40
its very interesting to take note of that

25:45
but regardless of that, what I have to say is, even when information comes in (that we can't hide), we try to fit in a theory, okay?

25:52
and usually all of that is due to a motivation, okay?

25:55
If you really want to know what the "motivation", then you can just look at the introduction we spoke of

26:03
that will make you a sense (of getting it more clear)

26:04
here we go to some philosophers, okay?

26:10
We go with philosopher "Buber", and philosopher Buber brought 2 concepts

26:16
"I-it" and "I-Thou"

26:18
So "I-Thou" really sees things from the perspective of you know, a theory

26:29
its a time when we really daydream, where we are immersed on something else and we don't look information from the external environment

26:38
so in such sense, people are immersed on an external (beyond this world) environment

26:44
and its good to be immersed on an external environment to process information like solving a problem like the landing gear

26:50
but we have to improve that theory (we are immersed in), to a better one, that fits more (stuff within the present environment), (to focus) on the bigger picture

26:59
If we are too focused, too narrow focused, then we are not very social responsible

27:07
The "I-It" is when we focus on the external environment, when we are present in this environment

27:18
And Buber has said that we go into those 2 dimensions from time to time, daydreaming and then looking at the external environment

27:25
and how do we react on the external environment (with new information)?

27:29
Whether we accept that information to fit in the theory that we are immersed or

27:33
we don't, is very very critical

27:36
now we go to the other one (that uses black box differently)

27:40
the one that "uses" black box, opens the black box, to use it, to solve a solution, like

27:48
the airplane fuel reserves thing

27:54
here we go again

27:59
oh my god, this camera does not like to focus

28:03
individual that uses black box when it is required

28:06
what candidates can this be?

28:08
the private investigator of course on an airplane industry

28:12
who else can?

28:14
be "more" without a motivation to find out the truth

28:18
and then (the next candidate), a beginner's mind

28:21
I will talk to you later about a beginner's mind

28:24
Information that challenges a theory

28:27
Expressed such info even if its not visible, you know?

28:32
If nobody saw it, I will show it to you

28:35
And Influences the theory to adapt within the new information

28:39
the theory changes

28:41
so here we have 2 versions, one that stuffs in black box, the other that uses the black box

28:48
It seems like we have to go to another philosopher

28:53
Its about Thomas Kuhn, scientific revolutions, I mean even the black box thinking book was influenced by this book

29:03
a lot of people, even me, got influenced by that book, and what it really says is

29:09
a lot of the revolutions in the science that happened over our community happened from people that were new to the science community

29:17
that had a beginner's set of mindset

29:20
and you know, those were able to fit existing information that was rejected by the old people in the scientific community

29:30
that had a lot of experience, and the (young scientists besides all that) created a better theory

29:34
it was like a life and death cycle, new science revolutions happened due to other people who had a more beginner mind

29:43
a private investigator is also a beginner's mind

29:48
what we can say about is

29:54
this (misuse of black box) is a problem that we have today in society very widely

29:59
the thing how to fix that , well, there is a lot of ways to fix that

30:04
we have private investigators, the other thing is

30:09
we do anonymous reporting, you know

30:11
anonymous reporting really helps (in some way)

30:14
if my motivation makes me not to disclose information, then how can I disclose information?

30:24
Anonymous reporting, I would not get punished, I can disclose it.

30:29
There are other forms that you can see that do not help. Instead we stuff things in the black box. For instance

30:39
Companies don't provide feedback or people are not transparent on their world

30:47
That is very obvious like in facebook, where (they call this behavior) the "facebook effect"

30:55
we only focus only on the good stuff and we hide all the bad stuff

30:59
and also on companies when an employee has a problem about the company

31:03
what the company says is here is the severance package, don't tell anything what happened, don't lawsuit us, hide that information.

31:10
so we have a lot of problems in society (where people or organizations) stuff things in a black box

31:15
and the main reason because of that is because I said on the beginning

31:20
is because people want to blame stuff based on the negative things they did and instead it should be part of their personal growth

31:29
How can we change that? Look, as a community, like, we use that facebook thing, and, you know

31:37
scientist, neurologists, and others were not able to create a social network that make individuals better

31:44
they (facebook) created a product that its still good, but people (think all is equal) when they can do whatever they want

31:50
we have a paradigm in here (the current society we live in)

31:52
A person can do whatever they want, I also discussed that in my blog, which you can see

31:59
To summarize about it (that blog post) is: We have done a lot of atrocities when a person tries to influence another person

32:11
That can be like the world war 2 (ideologies), the schemes that they created like germany (eugenics) or the slavery (secular religion)

32:23
Those can be just few examples what happens when we use a theory to impose another person

32:32
Its (those events) were not done in a rational manner

32:35
and we don't want to do that again

32:37
so that is why we have a free world where we can do everything we want (as long) we don't influence the other person

32:43
That is why we are very sensitive and we are very irrational on how we handle, how we categorize people when they do mistakes

32:58
we are not very rational on the personal matters

33:01
the solution right now what we do is

33:08
the old people don't know what they do or the old organizations don't know what they do

33:14
put the new people in here to replace the old people

33:18
its a life and death cycle, okay?

33:20
then after 5 years, replace (the previously new people) with somebody else

33:23
so this is like a cycle, a vicious cycle

33:27
and what I really want to do is all the individuals, even the ones that stuff things in the black box

33:32
lets transform them in order to exponentially grow our community

33:37
long term wise, to make a community where we can learn from mistakes

33:45
and the only way to do that is like "this book", this black box book, is based on neurology

33:51
or neuroscience and other stuff, or I mean all of this stuff, even in my blog, it all comes, back to neurology

33:59
and also by the cause and effect of the individual, and its by (academic) studies and all that

34:05
The thing is (neurology) is a very closed community, its not part of the business

34:12
Its not a part that we live everyday, its a very side step thing (side quest of a video game)

34:20
its a mini project, its like a pet project, it is like the scientist community in the renaissance age

34:27
where they used science to create weapons of mass destruction

34:33
its in the same sense in here. personal development is used right now these days just to meet the gratification

34:42
of people through entertainment and other types of ways, but at the same time we made a society that

34:51
is very convenient for us, where we don't have to do manual work, everything is automated, everything is abstract, but in terms of quality of communication

35:01
we are still in the stone ages because we have chosen to be whatever we want to be and to do

35:06
That is great, it is great to have a choice, that we can stuff things in a black box or be more social responsible

35:15
but I think as a community, I think (instead of treating them both equal), we should say that, you know

35:20
its more valuable when the individual focuses and chooses to be more social responsible

35:26
That concludes me that I want to create a social network

35:33
I want to bootstrap that social network, I am gonna experiment it

35:37
I will even volunteer if there are other similar networks like that

35:43
that focuses on neurology, that solves problems black box thinking (discuss)

35:53
That way we can make our community better

35:57
I think quality of relationships is a thing that everybody demands

36:00
and they (individuals) have problems (of it) everyday

36:02
So why don't we make (a solution) in a universal way

36:04
A social network that has the main building blocks to make our life better

36:10
Some of the stuff I have in my blog and its based on the model of mental symmetry

36:14
and I think that is the closest one, because people right now

36:18
scientists, are very professional on one field, but they don't integrate all those fields into one

36:25
where it can be applied to the individual to make their life better

36:29
At the same time, (at start) it will be simple, simple like a "bicycle" at first, but then we can make it like a "bullet train"

36:35
now its really junk, what we will create in a bootstrap, but it will still be helpful to individuals to understand me, understand others, and so on.

36:45
So that is my adventure. I don't know what, but that will be my motivation

36:51
bootstrap something, if it doesn't work out, other companies may follow, just motivate them to create something, volunteer them, work with them

36:58
I don't know (how it will end up), but that is all

37:01
I am just an individual, I understand (my limitations), I have a wife, I have my limits

37:06
I understand, I cannot do everything, but I can just volunteer (however that road goes)

37:10
and thanks for watching and that was the black box presentation and my motivation (for driving the next social network) of the future

37:16
Thank you
