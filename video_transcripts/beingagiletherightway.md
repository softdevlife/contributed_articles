Hello, welcome to my first presentation for discussing some things.

0:09
about balancing development and research

0:13
and today's main topic is about being agile the right way

0:20
this is just a small version of the detailed conceptualized thoroughly article I have within my blog.

0:34
Let me start and talk about this

0:38
So first of all, I have here some notes so I can reference.

0:47
Let me tell you on one of my workplace environments

0:53
The problems I had.

0:55
So, the first thing is, one of my workplace environments

1:02
I had to test some modules that I had no ownership of.

1:07
They were outsourced to another company

1:11
Our company workplace we followed agile methodology

1:18
but in my opinion, that methodology was too agile

1:23
Yeah, there was a like lot of pressure with customers

1:26
Pushing people to bring deliverables on time

1:32
I think that pressure made our development community

1:39
Not really have the time to understand the source code

1:43
And that was very obvious to me because

1:46
Everytime I did black box testing, there was an issue

1:51
with one of the combination of getting the same result in the program

1:57
Everytime for a series of months & it was (still) never fixed

2:02
The problem with agile methodology is if you don't understand the source code,

2:06
then you will create a testing environment that is impossible to test because

2:12
after so many black box testing of an agile methodology

2:16
as opposed to a waterfall methodology

2:18
giving a lot of features and combinations

2:20
creating a chaotic environment makes

2:22
as opposed to waterfall methodology, a very very hard way to test things out

2:27
If you don't even have a small space to do white test boxing

2:32
then black box testing is an unfeasible task

2:34
So that at some point you know there was a lot of blame game

2:42
For the testers not doing their job right

2:45
But in my opinion it was the developers who did not understand the source code

2:50
Even if they had senior status and really knew the stuff (tools) and worked in many other high tech corporations

2:57
I still feel that they had their accountability which they never took account for

3:02
To have some ownership of understanding the code

3:07
Some ownership from (the issues of) testing where you know

3:09
If the tester does black boxing 5 times and its wrong (fails) then the blame should go to the developer

3:15
And the developer instead should do the testing

3:18
And I tried to communicate this into a whole email

3:24
But the thing is, from the background as far I listened

3:29
the outsource company that took part (in our business)

3:31
It was more like a hierarchical, too structured, silo (environment) in communicating things.

3:37
There was a lot of blame game without any real reasoning on most things.

3:47
At one point you know, they couldn't handle anything

3:51
on the "tasks"stuff

3:55
The communication with the development of the outsource team with us

3:59
started to halt (stall things)

4:00
Less respect (on developers) and instead we were talking all our stuff

4:05
with the leader of the outsource team

4:06
which had more "people" skills

4:09
At the sacrifice of not handling the task or the technical debt (which is a big tension)

4:18
we tried to handle it by putting patches or working overnight

4:22
by fixing the business debt

4:25
by talking to the leader

4:26
and that felt like a positive thing for us communicating (in such a way) to the outsource team

4:37
but that is really a spell for disaster

4:41
what happened in the end was, that is what I heard is,

4:48
that company doesn't work with that outsource team anymore

4:51
When you are too agile, it really fails.

4:54
Now, then I went to another workplace environment

4:58
where they were in a transition that found out that too agile does not work

5:02
It was ugly

5:03
So a fix for that was setting up a bureaucratic and hierarchical system

5:12
The notion was to try to understand the whole thing (source code)

5:16
I think that is the other opposite edge (that represents) the waterfall methodology

5:23
If you try to understand everything, then you cannot really be good at understanding "some" things

5:31
that you can expand broadly to your client needs.

5:34
You should only understand what you really need that really exponentially grows the customer needs.

5:41
while making the less technical debt as possible

5:48
At the same point, there was a lot of hierarchy in place

5:52
that there was no more enforcement of remote working

5:54
there was less use of the social technological tools like KANBAN or SCRUM

5:59
And there was more enforcement of face-to-face non-verbal communication showing authority

6:04
Its like those medical companies, even in the United States currently, that what they do is

6:13
just show social status to embrace everything to be regulated

6:23
And the economy has shown again and again that does not really work in an economic environment

6:30
Especially for the long term

6:32
So the point is they should start being again a flat hierarchy organization.

6:39
At the same time, put some rules

6:43
while listening to the customers, they (customers) can handle technical debt

6:49
and understand (to) have ownership on those stuff (source code)

6:53
Tell them that you have ownership and you have to understand the source code

6:57
And if a technical debt comes, revoke their access or respect of giving them authority anymore

7:05
And they can only gain back (authority) after they can fix that technical debt

7:09
Its that simple

7:12
Because we want them (to be free) as long they don't produce technical debt

7:17
to have the freedom to do whatever they want

7:19
in order to bring business needs

7:22
A lot of business needs, that others can outcompete us if we don't create a lot of business needs

7:28
It cannot work in a hierarchical way

7:31
We create less business needs

7:33
We will cut short, especially from the main pipeline (that generates business)

7:40
that it is required to keep pace with the competitive environment we live in

7:48
The main point is, while also doing that (freedom as long technical debt is handled)

7:53
we have to really care about the people

7:57
you have to keep that environment agile

8:01
where everybody is engaging, trusted, and communicated to each other.

8:05
That cannot happen if your feedback (for not handling the technical debt)

8:10
is not without a good profounding reasoning with facts instead of blind faith and authority

8:17
You have to have facts where the person can solve the technical debt

8:21
when you present the facts in a very easy way

8:25
where those (facts) have a good reasoning enough

8:28
instead of using it as an abuse to use it as a social status power

8:33
which we all can be childish on that presence

8:39
In one of my workplace environments

8:42
we had one supervisor who just left now (in that organization)

8:47
some months or years ago

8:50
and (he showed) a good way of giving feedback to others with facts and reason

8:55
He handled the technical debt, he restricted power effectively

8:59
by saying you know, his own mind, why, the reasoning, the facts, of why it was wrong

9:05
and that is something, you know, people were still engaging on him

9:10
because there was a reason behind it (his feedback)

9:12
that people could just adjust and amend to these needs

9:16
And we all want leaders, who give accountability while giving freedom

9:21
and giving good reasons

9:23
good positive feedback, constructive feedback

9:25
or else, people will be afraid, be stuck and feel like they are in a hierarchy

9:32
even when they say its a "flat" heirarchy

9:35
we really have to limit or handle the technical debt

9:39
and also to give freedom to the people the correct way
