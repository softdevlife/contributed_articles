I have followed Greece from 2008 on its bailout program.

0:08
Now 2015, 8 years have passed where the Greek economy is still worse than its aftermath events of its 2008 economic depression

0:21
Nevertheless, the problem through those 8 years was that while there was effort to deregulate the public sector,

0:33
there was not a lot of effort on the innovative growth for the most of the labor market (especially for the young generation) on demanding careers

0:46
and to bring productive work environments that provided self-management skills for their capacity to gain more responsibilites in their workplace.

0:55
Simultaneously, within those 8 years, it was very unrealistic for the European Union to deregulate Greek's public sector within a very short deadline

1:05
A public sector, which its influence of control it had compared to other nations, was almost second to none

1:14
One public sector that had so much weight that was much worse than an "idol", the red paper and many more

1:25
shows that it controls the stucture of the country by containing most the of labor workforce of Greece.

1:33
While the European Union achived goals for the growth of the Greek economy,

1:41
it did not paid attention in that limited time how much pressure and hard work

1:48
it would take to accomplish this unrealistic goal of managing the tax evasion and deregulation of the public sector.

1:58
If however the European Union observed the challenges ahead, it would instead have implemented more oppotunities and investments

2:06
that motivated innovative growth while leaving their rest of the primary goals to run at a slower pace.

2:15
Unofortunately, the recipe of the European Union left the greek people to take sacrifices that where beyond their tolerance.

2:25
The results were the following: Unemployment increased from 8% to 25%.

2:33
If we know that 25% of the unemployment represents the average, then we can say that the unemployment is over 30% for the young generation and female gender.

2:45
For these reasons, can you imagine how much innovation and diversity we have in our labor force?

2:55
The taxes increased from 19% to 23%. The purchasing power decreased.

3:04
Big companies,lot of graduates and employed people with good financial well being,

3:11
left the country and liquidated their assets

3:18
the trust of the people on this country was fading out.

3:26
For these reasons, this year, the socialist party Siriza took control of all the political demands in Greece.

3:36
The goal from the European union deregulating the Greek public sector for its economic growth was too optimistic

3:47
and twisted because they didn't pay attention and they didn't did enough effort to bring a substitute working environment

3:58
that brought prosperity and sustainability for the most workers affected

4:04
In contrast, it left the environment without management, it left the habits of the Greek individual and the Greek Communities, regardless if they brought value or not any value,

4:15
to still be clenched with the public sector.

4:20
Now I don't know about the future of the referendum.

4:24
I don't care now whether its right or whether its wrong.

4:30
Or whether that action was right or that action was wrong.

4:33
I am talking about how the greek people ended up to this point, the motivation behind the greek people

4:42
that they came to this point: To vote this socialist party and to take part of this referendum.

4:48
And that is something that we all can easily ignore without care.

4:52
And that is something that we all can easily ignore without care.

5:03
What matters

5:09
(What matters) is that while there was a lot of "success stories" shown in the news that Greek is almost done with the bailout program,

5:19
it was all just a fictional story when most of the people that voted that socialist party or did not voted could not trust or have confidence of that vision.

5:30
The new party brought back the regulations of the government and the benefits to the people who were in a financial turmoil.

5:38
because they felt that their duty was not to punish the innocent, on an austerity program

5:45
that within 8 years, they didn't brought any alternative path for them as I explained before.

5:52
In summary, we can say that the European Union paid more attention for the stabilization of it currency

6:02
and less for the prosperity of the greek workforce on a sustainable environment.

6:07
They should had put austerity measures that placed care for the people instead of only the tasks that could bring economic growth to the Eurozone.

6:18
Due to the behavior of the European Union, we now have a socialist party that tells us that we violate natural laws

6:30
by derugalating the public sector and cutting government benefits for the lower class.

6:36
Here we go to the theater show of "holding a hot pot".

6:42
In other words, it looks that we aimlessly judged our Greek failure only by the consistency of austerity measures that the european union has showed to us.

6:54
only by the consistency of austerity measures that the european union has "showed" to us.

7:00
We take the European leaders actions as the absolute truth for Greek's current state, with only exit to act backwards.

7:10
But theoretically, that is what will happen, when one "hot pot", that represents in this case the public sector,

7:20
that takes cumulative urgent pressures without negotiations from the "hand", that represents the European Union,

7:29
regardless of the European Union actions being right or wrong, instead of the "hot pot" being under the control of the "hand",

7:36
the "hand" will be burned if the "hand" does not read the situation of how hot the "hot pot" is now with the current socialistic party in place.

7:46
And because the European Union holded a hot pot that was too hot for too long, the president of the socialist party took it as an advantage to present his ideology that has a preference

7:56
of equality for each individual and the embracement of a European Union culture that focuses more on the collective thought instead of each country's contributions.

8:04
If that party thinks only for the people and the people,

8:10
without changing the people's attitude clenching on the public sector, without the inception of an environment that promotes an innovative and productive environment,

8:20
instead will bring a society where equality will be unfair, where common sense will show us that each citizen cannot attain same priviliges,

8:27
It will bring an idle environment where all people will not be motivated to bring something better in this competitive hungry world.

8:34
But I have to say the following: The European Union did not brought the correct recipe and its paying the price today from the previous Greek opposing party that presently rules today.

8:48
That if the European Union implemented the words of the opposing party at that time, the European Union would have not faced this situation.

8:53
The mistake of the European Union was on the persistence of the same strategy that the previous opposing party used it as an advantage to take the throne today.

9:02
The European Union never expected the socialist party to take control over Greece.

9:08
They did a big bet and they played the cards wrong.

9:13
To listen the speech of the referendum, I have left some comments bellow this video

9:24
where you can listen and understand the words

9:30
And the final behavior of the Greek society. On how they ended in this place now.

9:38
And that is the only thing I focus on this video, not on the actions, but instead of the real reason how we ended up here now.

9:48
Thanks for listening.
