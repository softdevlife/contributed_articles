A paradigm shift mindset for how us and the rest of us should react from bad emotional experiences

Black Box Thinking is one of the best books that touches the heart topic of why our society these days is so ill-mannered on how we treat others and how afraid we are from other blaming us these days. We always constantly blame other people, filling in the gaps that do not exist, with our generalizations. We always attribute failure as a negative connotation, being the whole reason or the whole motivation why everybody wants to hide the truth from the public. What you can learn through black box thinking is that it is okay to criticize specific topics that you are knowledgeable and don't fill in the gaps, it is okay to find the failures of others, but not as a dead end, but as their only way to gain any personal growth.

This book is more than just a treasure. It is a living creature that will challenge the current mindset of society. It will create a paradigm shift in how we perceive and treat individuals between today and tomorrow, a template that will prevent us doing the same mistakes over and over again no matter the situation.

I got inspired much by this book. It is great that this book became popular, so more people are aware of this problem.
