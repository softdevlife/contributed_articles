Black Box Thinking is one of the best books that touches the heart topic of why our society these days is so ill-mannered on how we treat others and how afraid we are from other blaming us these days. We always constantly blame other people, filling in the gaps that do not exist, with our own generalizations. We always attribute failure as a negative connotation, being the whole reason or the whole motivation why everybody wants to hide the truth on the public. What you can learn through black box thinking is that it is okay to criticize on specific topics that you are knowledgeable and don't fill in the gaps, it is okay to find the failures of others, but not as a dead end, but as their only way to gain any personal growth.

But this book is more than just a treasure, it is a living creature that will challenge the current mindset of society, it will create a paradigm shift on how we perceive and treat individuals between today and tomorrow, a template that will prevent us doing the same mistakes over and over again no matter the situation we are in.

I am really inspired by this. You can find more info on my twitter profile softdevlife: the videos, presentations, and some articles that revolve around this book through my blog activity. It is great that this book became popular so more people are aware of this problem.
