### Getting deep down the rabbit hole

Of all the topics we can discuss today, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain are the most that will get an average laymen person baffled. Many people forget that AI has always been considered a part of Computer Science for decades. They also neglect careers that are in huge demand, such as data analysts and data scientists. These job roles helped tremendously in delivering better products efficiently within the business by the use of artificial intelligence. 

Few people know the practical applications of Blockchain. The whole purpose of Blockchain is to revolutionize the way we verify sensitive daily transactions that require intermediaries these days. With its underlying infrastructure behaving in a decentralized way, it will bring business added value by replacing the intermediaries that we use today. Tell them the purpose of Blockchain and people will get completely lost with you. In contrast, they will immediately nod their heads if you mention Bitcoin within your conversation. It seems Blockchain has a wrong perception of its real implications. It is it treated as an investment tool instead of understanding the underlying infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies can still be a good investment as long companies place the appropriate business models.

### Hitting the sweet spot

Thankfully, Artificial Intelligence is in a good environment fit compared to Blockchain. Did you know that Artificial Intelligence was more popular than today in the 1960s and 1980s? It had the same hype we see today with Blockchain instead. Unfortunately, the computing resources at that time were not enough to create anything meaningful besides digit recognition. It was used in post office factories to organize mail by reading the zip codes in envelopes. With the advances in technology, some researchers found that they could replicate their findings in the 1960s by using Graphic cards instead of CPUs. In contrast to CPUs that work sequentially, Graphic cards can run their computations in parallel. Tinkering the model to run in parallel is what now allows us to have cars to drive without a driver among other things, as well data scientists and data analysts being more effective in helping businesses in their decision-making process.  That is another reason why graphics cards maker NVIDIA over the last 2 years increased its stock exponentially, catching up with CPU maker Intel. Graphics cards are not only for games anymore. 

Having the right environment is very critical for a specific technology to thrive. It allows more practical applications to incorporate within its eco-system. Take for instance Netflix. Netflix would not have been a viable business model if internet users did not have the proper bandwidth of streaming movies online. I remember in the early days of the internet that you had to spend at least half a day to download a one-minute movie clip. Fingers crossed if the computer crashed in the middle. We see something similar with a blockchain platform named Ethereum. Cryptokitties, a blockchain based virtual game took almost half of the traffic capacity of Ethereum, making the whole system unresponsive. In essence, Blockchain technology needs to focus on products that can become feasible within the current infrastructure provided.

Besides Blockchain needs a proper environment to thrive in its ecosystem, people need to place business models that fit well with the technology stack. Netflix is a perfect case of how it took advantage of the internet bandwidth ecosystem (which Blockbuster ignored, and eventually became bankrupt ). But how did Google replaced Yellow Books, Amazon replacing physical retail stores, and Messenger replacing your landline phone? All these companies above did not achieve their success overnight. Even if it was presently evident that they had the competitive advantage over what they were selling, providing those services for free in exchange for showing advertisements or selling the items at a cheaper price is not going to cut it. They still need to benchmark better among their rivals in reliability, customer experience, and customer service. Furthermore, it takes a lot of time to transition prospective users in changing their old habits to get in use of your better product. It requires a lot of creativity, discipline, effort, and patience. There may not be plenty opportunities for Blockchain, but there will surely be enough of business use cases where Blockchain can be a great fit. However, given Blockchain is at an early stage, building one on top of it is very challenging as it requires a lot of effort. Otherwise, if Blockchain revolves only around the hype of making money, we will see a lot of ideas becoming bankrupt in the same fashion as the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). In result, users will be more wary of the technology that will leave Blockchain in a stall state like AI did with its own [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter)

*The University of Helsinki offers an introductory course to Artificial Intelligence for free to everyone.* 

Although Blockchain has only been for us for only a decade, Artificial Intelligence has been sitting around for more than sixty years. I think most of us interact with Artificial Intelligence in many ways we never noticed. From the e-mail recommendations we receive from the online shopping sites we subscribed to the advanced photo filters in our phone camera that can detect our face, Artificial Intelligence is the key that enables them. But for the most part, Artificial Intelligence has shifted over the years to what tasks were considered and not considered AI anymore. 

I completed within a few days a course provided by the University of Helsinki called [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/). If you have the time, I recommend you take a deep dive into the course. It is small and out of all completely free. You only need an email to register. The course gives you a clear perspective of what AI used to represent and what it currently represents. For me, it was a great wrap up in connecting everything I knew about AI. The five sections the course provides are as follows:

### The old AI: AI problem solving

In AI problem solving, you learn more about how AI was viewed in the early times. AI was more about getting the knack for solving puzzles. It all started with AI beating opponents in Tic-Tac-Toe and chess that did not involve luck. The hypothesis is that as long as you know the pieces of your opponents and your own, you can derive out of all the possibilities within the rules of the game the best next move that will give you the leading advantage over the rest of the path within the game. The reason why this field of AI became outdated is that it did not handle uncertainty, such as games like Rock-Paper-Scissors (For more about that, read my book review [Uncertainty in Games by Greg Costikyan](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2020274638)). 

These problem-solving puzzles have practical applications that revolve around search and planning. For instance, Quintiq, a Dutch company that develops planning, scheduling, and supply chain optimization software, used to provide [a planning challenge puzzle](http://web.archive.org/web/20160306025725/careers.quintiq.com/puzzle.html#the-challenge) in order to screen candidates who loved puzzles or could automate it with algorithms. Quintiq considered solving puzzles as a form of intelligence. Unfortunately, such methods are now taught to every computer science student and are not considered anymore Artificial Intelligence.

In order to solve these problems, there are two choices: doing an exhaustive search by brute force or using clever heuristics. I remember I competed in one informatics contest during my high school days were one of the challenges was to find the fastest destination from point A to point B. I used Dijkstra's Algorithm to solve it with the use of brute force. For simple games like tic-tac-toe, solving them by brute force is doable. But for other board games, such as chess, using clever heuristics is required.   

### The new AI: Statistics, Machine Learning & Neural Networks

Currently, all the products we discussed that revolve around AI today try to handle uncertainty by making decisions based on previous decisions. If you have enough data collected, you can use statistics to apply the naive Bayes classification formula to determine the likelihood of an event occurring. Other methods that can be used to make predictions are the nearest neighbor classifier for categorical assignment and regression for numerical predictions. Let us say you want to do a sentimental analysis of a feedback review. You can, for instance, use the Bayes classification formula to get the likelihood of each word of either showing happiness or sadness out of all the collected customer reviews. When a new customer review comes, the aggregate of the likelihood of all words within that review will determine whether it shows happiness or sadness. When a doctor checks your health, your numbers can be placed with other patients to determine whether you need to do further diagnostic checks by applying the nearest neighbor classifier. And if you plan to buy a house, you will try to check whether the selling price of the houses is overvalued or not by doing a regression of the rest of the houses that are being sold around the area. All the following revolve around information that is already classified by the end user. The algorithm in these cases does not need to figure out into how many categories a customer review should be placed. For instance, a customer review could either be categorized to either be three instead of two where their contents were either excited, anger or shocked instead of happiness or sadness. The algorithm does not need to detect into what categories these reviews need to be placed as they are already provided by the user.  These AI methods are called classification.

If the information is hard to be classified or we could bias our decisions if we classified the data by our own end, then AI needs to classify the information on its own. These AI methods are called clustering. One of the methods discussed is neural networks which are great for vision detection and applying the appropriate filters in an image. The method has become more efficient and effective with the use of convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Besides neural networks, there are other methods for clustering information, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering.

Needless to say, all current AI follow more or less the basics of machine learning. Machine learning starts learning from a training set and then learns on the go. It improves itself the more time it makes decisions and validates its mistakes to make better ones on the next run.  In other words, AI has a growth mindset where it encounters any event from a beginner's mindset. In contrast, the expert systems based on logic and human-coded rules was the dominant AI paradigm in the 1980s. 

### Demystifying AI

AI for some time had and still has a lot of hype of what it can do. It is very hard to educate people that AI cannot be used for everything. It is a discipline of its own, and as other disciplines like Blockchain,  will automate some tasks or make some tasks more efficient or better. Instead of looking at the field of AI alone, it is better to look at how diverse careers like Data Science use Artificial Intelligence in the workplace that adds added value to a business organization. For most of us, it is much better to get an intuition of the practical uses of AI instead of reading academic journals related to AI. For those reasons, its good to learn more what a Data Scientist in general does by reading my book review [Confident Data Skills by Kirill Eremenko](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2436084333).

The AI dangers that could impose on society are real. In the current state though, AI does not have the potential to behave in a smart way like humans do to the point of being a threat as extraterrestrials invading our country. Instead, their intelligence is still catered to specific problems. At this stage, given AI does not have the capacity of acquiring general intelligence like a human can, there is not much a possibility of AI controlling humans. Regardless, given AI has the autonomy to make decisions for us in specific problems, these are the ones that we should pay attention to:

* Resolving algorithmic bias on house mortgages, credit loans, and background checks.
* To authenticate videos in the Blockchain as videos can easily be fabricated with AI.
* To transition the workforce in times of AI automating some of their tasks.

Overall, AI has so many wrong perceptions that many businesses never give it a try within their daily operations. Even worse, many organizations do not possess a data-driven culture where data literacy among employees is totally absent. In times like these, is good to not advocate only AI, but why people should use data in their daily decisions. Read my book review [Winning with Data by  Tomasz Tunguz and Frank Bien](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2012681212) to learn more about how to turn your business oriented towards data.

## Getting to know more about Blockchain
![blockspaceasia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12673581/43367432-4d048810-937f-11e8-97cb-22951838e735.jpg)<br>
*Every year, BlockSpace Asia brings an event where several leaders discuss a variety of topics on Blockchain.*

Blochain, at this moment, is at its infancy. A lot of hype is going on. There are several new projects with whitepapers with very well aesthetically designed websites popping out on the internet every month with attractive ICO offers to early birders. At this point, it is very hard to discern the reality of these project. The whitepapers can seem reasonable, but they may oversell you on something they cannot really build. Where you attracted to invest in their idea just because their site was designed very attractively built by a graphic designer? If the site overwhelmed you emotionally that you could not able to think clearly, take a step back, and try to check whether investing them in the first place is a sound idea.

Since anything on the internet related to Blockchain can be shady, going to an event is a great idea. Last week, I went to an event that discussed Blockchain from several leaders in the field. Here are my takeaways: 

### Blockchain winter is coming...

If you take into account that 90% of the projects are scams with most of them having no product demos or prototypes to show, you have to start wondering if we are in some sort of bubble. If projects are short-lived and many of them do not make any practical sense to be applied in the blockchain in the first place, there is no much solid ground for this technology to fly out in the skies. Blockchain technology is starting to lose credibility these days as there have not been many practical applications to this day. Furthermore, the cost of incorporating these projects into the Blockchain ecosystem may not be worth for its benefits. Investors need to be careful by having certain criteria from discerning between good and bad Blockchain projects. For the less tech-savvy, having a consultant that can help you as an intermediary for your investment opportunities with Blockchain is best advisable.

### Blockchain has potential...

There is a lot of use cases though where Blockchain technology can be applied in projects. Take for instance abstracting the process of claims in insurance with blockchain contracts. In those instances, the intermediary of handling the insurance claim is gone and blockchain handles the transaction with automated code. Other good use cases are verifying the authenticity of products. Have you ever considered whether a supplier in the marketplace sold genuine branded products? Blockchain can help by having all the records the product went through from its origin. Looking forward, there will be more projects that revolve around removing the intermediary that authenticates users and retains data integrity.

### Looking at the future...

Admittedly, Blockchain is at the exploration phase just like AI did in its early days. The ones that will thrive are ones that prioritize ideas that will bring the most business impact within the current limitations of the technology.  They should focus on bringing their idea to fruition with the least investment. They should also have a viable product to demonstrate that people can try and use before asking for investments (most preferably, outside of ICO). The company should also need to have a great leadership team that can stick with the vision in times where the technology can face turbulent times. 

At the same token, users should know how to protect their cryptocurrency and ways to recover their cryptocurrency in case it gets lost. They should also be educated in how to make a wise investment and the ability to identify blockchain scams.
