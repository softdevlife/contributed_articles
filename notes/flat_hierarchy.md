# Problem: When an organization is too hierarchical

**Mission:**

1. For the ability customers to gain access of their business needs
2. To create a more collaborating, engaging, and trusting environment

## Create a Flat hiearchy
**How:** Less face to face communication means have less authority to others (only when circumstances are really need it) 

Do face to face communication only when:
* When sound accountability is reasoned by facts of technical debts not handled. 
* When on those few occasions things cannot be clarified much virtually. Those face to face conversations should be kept as short as possible. There is a saying that meetings suck, and they do when they become a waste of time.

**Replacement:** Embrace social technological tools where most of the feedback is flown through those channels. Let everyone be part of the development process instead of the few.

**Result:** More business needs accrued.

## Replace hierarchy with a structured paradigm that follows accountability on the event tasks are not respected "appropriately"
**How:** Show accountability to others in the event of people not understanding the source code they have ownership of or if you find out the system is not stable due to technical debt.
Give less respect or authority to those members until they fix the technical debt.

Show accountability only:
* When you have real facts at hand that are easy to understand and are repetitive, replicable in nature where everyone can believe them with a scientific mindset.
* Do not use accountability on any occassion which you think there is not a good sound judgment behind it and it is due to your mood swings or external pressures pushing you out from having neutrality.

**Replacement:** Instead of expressing authority with blind faith and hunches all the time, only do it with sound reasoning facts which shows explicitly that it hurts the documentation and the technical debt at hand.
             On all other cases, show 100% trust to anyone. Dispel any doubts until you have the facts and have at least already expressed them.

**Result:** Technical debt is handled and it is under control.
