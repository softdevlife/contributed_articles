# Final Fantasy 9 still the best game to learn more about our self

**Note:** The discussion below will include a lot of spoilers about the story of the game, you have been warned.

## The definition of a tragedy play
How do people end up with the right standards? Or become wicked? Learn more in this interactive forty-hour tragedy play called Final Fantasy 9.

Final Fantasy 9 story starts with a tragedy play. It later gets ruined by stealing the princess within that kingdom as was planned by the original cast of the play. After all, for better or worse, the tragedy play was done there for a diversion to steal the princess. But the game itself did not put the tragedy play in there as a diversion. Instead, the tragedy play was placed there to imply that the whole game on its own will be a Shakespeare tragedy play. As the story unfolds, you will see several story arcs each intertwined with a major event, characters transitioning from worst to better and better to worst, even the beautiful music composed by Nobuo Uematsu gives us the hopes, joys, and sorrows the characters go through each stage. Now converting a Shakespeare play into a different medium is not as easy as it seems. Unlike your average game, stories have a start, an interruption for a new adventure, and an ending. Most of those stories give life lesson but does not give several to make the main characters grow. A tragedy play has a series of events that make the character to go from A to B to instead to go from A to C to D to B and so on. One instance is the animated movie The Lion King. What makes it so popular is how the movie could fit so many events in a 90-minute movie. The story unfolds where the son and father are leaving peacefully (point A). At one event, father taught to son to remember his duty to protect his kingdom, to follow it as his father does, and that gets reinforced as a call to action for the son on representing that duty when his father dies (point B). However, that does not follow as expected. The son was very young when his father died and was lured to run away from the kingdom by the tricksters that killed his father (point C). In that new environment, he ended up being influenced by a bad gang about “Hakuna Matata”, to not worry about his duties, and start living a stoic life (point D). He got so used to not following the footsteps of his fathers until he was triggered from memories of his past self and intervened by familiar characters from the kingdom he used to live. Then all these events empowered him to go back to his kingdom and follow the steps of his father by defeating the trickster than stole his throne (point B). As you can see the characters progress direction is not flowing smoothly into a straight line. Instead, the character goes from up (living happily with his father) to down (running away from the kingdom) to up (becoming stoic) to down (realizing he doesn’t follow the steps of his father) to up (taking the kingdom of his father back). Meanwhile, you also see the development of villain characters as well as the story unfolds. When the trickster got his kingdom from the throne of his father, he was able to keep it under control. However, he only knew how to take things from others, not develop them, so what was developed, ended up in ruins, that even the individuals that helped him on assisting the death of the father went after him, ended up killing him in the end. As you can see, story arcs have like the Lion King can expand a story to unfold into months, years instead of going to a three-day Jumanji adventure and then life goes back to normal. With the allotted time, we have space to develop the characters in rich detail, even the villains do not full single dimensional. After all, people progress and grow in small incremental steps, it does not happen overnight. What the best can unfold overnight is having a memento or a souvenir at the end of the journey and hold it tight that it may develop you further down the road, but it will definitely not going to be showcased in this movie, only its subsequent sequel, and only if that sequel happens after several years from the original movie, leaving us a lot of gap to what went in the middle between the origin and its sequel. Without knowing the middle part of what went from point A for the character to develop to point B in these movies makes the full experience incomplete. For these reasons, tragedy plays, like the Lion King give us all the details of the mystery instead of movies that feed us by the spoon as in “Okay. This is the victim. And now this is the murderer. How did it happen? It does not matter. The case is closed”. However, the Lion King has crammed so much stuff within the 90-minute movie scene. You can’t explore a lot on a story arc when each is at most 10 minutes long. You have to squeeze as much as you can and put only the critical stuff in there.

## The structure of Final Fantasy 9 tragedy play
In contrast, Final Fantasy 9 is a video game that can take 40 hours. Yes, most of the part is battles, but since they had so much room to discuss a story full of arcs, they incorporated a lot of those parts inside the battle scenes as well. There are plenty of bosses in this game and most bosses have different phases within the battle. Each phase gets triggered as the boss character gets depleted more in life. You learn more about the characters as they start to become weaker and weaker. Furthermore, the battles that happen are not only in a few locations. The game encompasses more than a dozen locations where each has its own different theme, history, and take a meaningful part of the story to progress. Some places trigger special events for specific characters to develop, some other places trigger the main storyline to a different direction than it was going, and so on. All in all, Final Fantasy 9 plays the same mechanics as the movie the Lion King, taking the main characters in different events that take them up and down until they become at their best form. This element of the main characters of being from the worst to the best is called the “anti-hero”. At first, the characters are a blindsight of their own failures. For instance, Zidane is a total jerk that only cared about chasing beautiful women as we learn from what he did in the past, Steiner places too much loyalty on something without evaluating it from time to time and Amarant trusts no one other than himself to the point he does not see the occasions when collaborating with others is more beneficial. In fact, I do not need to prove that the game follows in that principle. If you leave the game idle, you will see a screensaver where it will randomly pick every few seconds the main character with a quote of the challenges they are facing with:

* **Zidane:** _Virtue_ — You don’t need a reason to help people.
* **Freya:** _Despair_ — To be forgotten is worth than death.
* **Vivi:** _Sorrow_ — How do you prove that you exist…? Maybe we don’t exist…
* **Dagger:** _Devotion_ — Someday I will be queen, but I will always be myself.
* **Steiner:** _Dilemma_ — Having sworn fealty, must I spend my life in servitude?
* **Quina:** _Indulgence_ — I do what I want! You have a problem!?
* **Amarant:** _Arrogance_ — The only dependable thing about the future is uncertainty
* **Eiko:** _Solitude_ — I don’t wanna be alone anymore

As you can see from above, the game above develops all the eight characters within the forty-hour gameplay going through the up and downs until they are able to solve their own challenges. Of course, to make it more exciting, all the story does no revolve of the same set of main characters. Some main characters come at the middle or the end of the storyline. So as you have guessed, at the second part of the game, we see those characters that come late into the storyline getting more space on learning more about the background. Furthermore, in a lot of cases, the whole party gets split into two parts into several occasions in order to have two story arcs happening at the same time. For instance, while Zidane is trying to find out a way to save his friends being trapped by the main villain Kuja, his trapped friends found a way to get out. So you switch back and forth between those events to make it the storyline more interesting and refreshing and realistic. Another reason is in some cases is it makes sense for only a few characters be in a particular act as if they where in a group with others, they would not be free to speak if they where tagged along. For instance, the events when Steiner and Dagger going alone speaks quite a lot about the challenges Steiner is facing on his loyalty with his kingdom. He never had the time to think it quietly when he was going along with others and speak out his own mind instead of yelling the blame to others, so those occasions while being alone with princess Dagger gives him the trigger to contest more to his anti-hero patterns.

Overall, we can see that a lot of detail was put into this game in production. Being part of the final iteration of Final Fantasy within the PlayStation 1, they tried to not only squeeze out the graphics performance within the system but bring the best elements of a storyline and philosophical concepts from its previous Final Fantasy iterations. Now that it has been re-released into every console (even coming to Nintendo soon) in High Definition, there is no much way you can make an excuse to not put this game into your entertainment backlog.

## The main highlights of the characters in the game
It is a definitely great game to learn about how our upbringing and attitude towards the events can end us up into different directions. For instance, Zidane upbringing was in a theatrical play (yes, the cast are actually a gang of thieves, but you cannot ignore that what they do in their free time is theatrical stuff) and he later falls in love with the Princess. That made him have a bigger purpose in life and live into the fullest while facing his own challenges. Vivi, an artificial living thing, facing the knowledge that he may end up at some point being stopped and never starting again (a nice way to say to a robot how death will look like), admits its fate and faces his days of life with full of meaning to himself and to the others that face the same fate as long as it lasts. In contrast, Brahne was easily manipulated by Kuja to gain power and be insecure of others to the point that her paranoidness was beyond the normal lines of common sense. Kuja, least but not last, started his life, not full of love, but full of jealousy. Zidane was a better artificial clone than him that can live a normal life while Kuja life has a short lifespan. Unlike taking things in good vibe as Vivi did, Kuja without anybody to support him at times like this ended up to become a trickster and devour the world with him as his time was ending up.

It makes sense that we live today in a world with a deconstructionalism mindset where everything that we do is totally fine because there is the assumption that there is no right or wrong of what we do. In other words, we are arrogant like Amarant. Or else if we were obedient to what was right or wrong, we would be obedient without evaluating our loyalty like Steiner was. But when Amarant asked how Zidane was able to traverse a life where he could help others, his reply was more in the words because he was always trying to find the meaning of it as he went through. It is all about our consciousness of finding meaning that we can find the path of what is good and bad in front of us. Being unconscious and following meaning laid by others and we would be Steiner. Being conscious and decided to not follow any meaning and we become arrogant like Amarant. In many ways, Amarant and Steiner learned a lot from Zidane. Steiner was more conscious to Zidane and accepted him to be a part ally of the kingdom because he started to evaluate him by the deed he did in the past and not anymore about what his role was represented (a thief). Amarant at the same time tried to be more resourceful to others and found out that he should not put out his efforts and hopes out so soon.

Ironically, Quina, Eiko, and Freya, all being female, are the extreme elements of what Dagger weaknesses went through on the storyline. At first, Dagger was a rebel, she wanted to explore the world outside of the kingdom, be a different person than a princess (Zidane tried to assimilate her on speaking less elegantly), it was actually that she wanted to be kidnapped instead of being forced to be kidnapped. However, as she went along, she felt at moments lonely when Zidane was absent. When Alexandria was rebuilding itself, Dagger was out of your main party, and until Zidane came back, the signs of Dagger missing Zidane are shown non-verbally. Last but not least Dagger always wishes the worst to not happen, to not miss the one she loves the most, like Freya losing her boyfriend. These elements of rebellion, loneliness, and missing someone are elaborated on detail when meeting the characters Quina, Eiko, and Freya. Once you get to know them well from those characters and you encounter those feelings in Dagger during the events, you have a good grasp knowing what is happening on her, yet you don’t know why. Albeit all those circumstances that show Dagger her sensitive part of her self, we all see that they are shown non-verbally, suppressed, and covers it up because she needs to show she is strong and bold for the role of being a responsible Queen that can be accountable of the people that she has to protect. So on each part of the story, Dagger gets interrupted from the role of a queen: She becomes a rebel, a lover, a person of grief of losing someone, yet under all those circumstances, she gains the composure to still take the duty of the queen. In order to understand that further, we have to remember the scene when Dagger tried to cut the hair. On the last parts of the storyline, after her mother passed away and her kingdom remained in ruins, Dagger cut her long hair. It showed that she wanted to earn the reputation of a princess all over again. As you can see from the dialogue, the characters tell her that she is not pretty anymore as before. That she now is more of her “own self”. A person that is their own self can show more strongly the feelings of falling in love with Zidane and in some way indirectly confessing about it before Zidane goes all alone and tries to save Kuja. All in all, when she was able to face and accept she has her own personal life as anybody else does, the easier it was for her to be as a princess as well because it was never a choice whether she had to be a princess or be her own self, she could be both.
