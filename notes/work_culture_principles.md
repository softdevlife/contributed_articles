# Work Culture
## Principles
- The first priority is **external**: to have, keep, and achieve a `sustainable model`. There are many ways to do this, but the end result is this: In order to keep the staff happy, you need to pay them at least the market rate. In other words, its all about having the correct `supply` and `demand` and making the community a better place progressively (it pays long term wise to do that in the end!)

- The second priority is **internal**: To care about the product and the people who are working there. Product is made out of people. So the source of all effect is by people. In order to really care about the people, be strategic on an environment that keeps BOTH `tasks` efficiently WHILE accommodating `people's` workflow in productive roles.

- The third priority is to have a **balance** to the `external` and `internal` roles of the business: As simple as it sounds, there are stories where: 

1. Many care about the internal implications why the staff don't work productively in a business model that is not sustainable 
2. A corporation that is very abundant from external sources that doesn't mind or care to find out why it has a high turnover rate of employees with bad management choice of keeping balance of what is going internally. 

> This results in a company that later on may become susceptible with its limited staff to implement their vision.

## Conclusion
- Follow those 3 principles and you have work culture. 

- Don't follow them, and you are away from having a sustainable work culture.
