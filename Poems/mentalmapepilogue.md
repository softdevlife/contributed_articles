We reach the epilogue of creating a mental map.
What I learned is
Our default destiny is to be passive consumers of society
Education may give us a starting deck of cards to play with
Cards that are safe that can prosper us an average life

But leaving us live beneath the background of the main action
Civilization progress on the toes between the ground and sea
It is between embracing or having fear of the big torrent of life: 
Whether there are underlying virtues or not

Virtues of expressing our generalizations with content
Always looking at the big picture beyond our domain when validating them
And by always on the attitude of the personal growth of ourselves and others
And not by the means of blaming others and placing them as a dead end
The coin value of the word "forgiveness" has become cheap
Requiring a new definition for people to understand 
Like Black Box Thinking book by Matthew Syed illustrates

Virtue of our habits to use our internal self-esteem 
But be careful
For the mind does not discern whether a fact came from emotions or observations
The mind treats them the same
Always evaluate where that self-esteem comes
As it may reach to the wrong reality, wrong destination
If there is will, you have the choice whether you want it to be influenced by others or by your own convictions
like The Power of Habit book by Charles Duhigg illustrates

The virtue of us being alive in this world
What does it represent our beliefs and are they of good nature?
Like the Plato of the Greater Good as it was originally intended by low motives?
Or the Plato of the Greater Good of Medieval times
Of a good that is unreachable that we can never get closer to?
Do we want to be asleep or be alive?
To be or not to be?
We have the power in progressing our civilization for its personal ease and personal development. 
It is all up to us whether we want to volunteer in this great work instead of looking from the background
We need to be active in this world and think critically for what is the right thing to do
Like Natural Cognitive Theology by Lorin Friesen illustrates

These virtues make your playing deck stronger from the starter deck
A deck that can stand out and make a difference
Once you get enough strong cards on your deck, don't be afraid to play
It will get time getting used to playing the rules of the game

But these cards
If you figure how to play them correctly
Those are the only cards that you will ever need to rely on.
And as long staying true to the purpose of those cards, it will be more of an ease for you to conquer even stronger cards.

As a Perceiver, I am just a collector right now.
That is not the right way to play the game.
You have to get up in the ranks to show it
Otherwise, you are not attached to those cards

For those of you that are still on the starting deck, have faith
Start to understand the rules of the game
So you are able to discern which cards are better than others
And once you have a thin grasp on it, take a risk and buy in

You will definitely find some good cards if you know where you suppose to search
Collect enough that you feel nobody can stop you
Where your words will be a silence for any objections
And if they don't, you will know how to prove it
By placing the correct variables multiple times 
Because this is not only a game of statistics
But finding the correct variables in the rule of the game
Like handling chaos with a dancing star

Our ultimate destination is to be righteous.
That is our only obstacle.
It is different to believe in these strong cards
If you still play at the same level
with the same starting deck cards you previously had
To switch them, you have to have the valor to face 
stronger opponents, insane challenges, and huge responsibilities
In an environment, that has big repercussions 
when they don't understand clearly your message
when you make a small mistake
you have to have the right tactics 
in order to get your winning cards the most across

In order to venture this journey
You must be well prepared and in good condition
Take care of yourself
Practice your cards in a safe environment
This will require some time
And you will be all set

You must be here already in the first place
Because you know all things can be better
And you know it is not out of your selfish desire
But for the greater good of our civilization
That is all you need to set confidence to the righteous destination
There is few who go on such journey
And oh, so you will be a great hero, reaching the ground by waving in the river

When your cards are set
When you played enough
And are fit enough
Then nudge yourself
To play the game
You were preparing for
Since the day you realized
That you were born
For progressing society
How else can you be motivated
not doing what you prepared for
