THINK BEFORE YOU DO!

"Hold on my child! Watch your step!" 
My father could say enthusiastically to me
"Think before you do!" 
"The more you think first, the more abundant your life will be!" 

That was the best blessing words of my father
To this day, I follow those words everyday
But oh might you! I still fail often with daily temptations devouring me
But I stir away as much as I can as the day that I did not forget and haunts me still says upon to me:

Remember the day where my great father's vessel burst out one day 
Temptation made him to use quick make up instead of cleansing his body
Temptation that drove him to a fruitless life instead of a fruitful one
Yet devoured by nothingness, his soul was still there speaking to me on his last minutes of life
"Oh, I wish I was a robot where I could always follow my words and do not fall prey of temptation!"
"But robot am I not, but robot I wish I was"

My father was a proud nuclear engineer, graduated from different countries, caliber second to none
He worked in many senior and chief executive positions
Within dozen of nuclear engineer locations across the world
Attain fortune more than he could imagine, owning boardwalk and park place

One day, his vessel burst out, but he didn't notice, he thought today was still as yesterday
He didn't think first and instead moved first
He got greedy, he lost his ethics, he was driven by impulse
The law didn't multiply him and instead he invested in nothingness
He lost all that he attained

Fast forward today and I am here holding still the blessed words of my father
It is words that I share to you because they blessed me instead of cursed me
"Think before you do"
Anybody can do what they already do
But few think what they already do

The more I followed those words
The more it saved me from everyday disasters that were coming miles away
Where others could do but not think
That their actions that do not hurt now will hurt them later

I lived in places that were abundant and places that were not abundant by nature
Regardless of nature, to think before you do is always correct no matter what
For as those who think they don't do much, they think they have thought of everything for they did not
For as those who think rightly, they will not conceit or be arrogant for escaping their own thinking
For as those who think rightly, they will think of what they have not thought instead of thinking how to escape their thoughts

To places that were not abundant, people have no choice but to follow our divinity, the rule of the law
However, many followed laws to keep what they already was not abundant instead of expanding their world to be abundant
Foolish as they be! 
For they followed how to keep what they already had instead follow the divinity and integrity of our society. 
The herds that followed them, the next generation to be, they were living on a cause far less than they ought to be
Only cattle that was blind could follow such master, cattle that likes to waste the abundance of the world inefficently
Cattle that do not think, but only do
Because although their master rightly thought of the divine rules of the law
Clenched the master was, with arrogance, to his world that was not abundant, to keep it for himself until he died
As those people that they don't think for the great good of society are sick - fonded only on their property

But I tell you, fear not for what you already have done
As god has mercy on you
For laws cannot be followed, but only learned
And one day, let shall cross our path, where I teach you to me, and you teach to me
For that is the real kingdom of god
As for today, I say to you, think before you do!

To places that were abundant, people are lucky and have the choice not to live life with divinity
But deluded they indeed are as the abundancy is just an illusion
As although indeed all great things in life come to an end and they only start to come over again once we do great things again
Fear not! For I tell you, you do not have to follow that vicious cycle, for as long you do great things eternally, eternally you will receive the fruits of eden

In worlds that are abundant, you see two groups: one that creates democracy and another that colonizes
Countries that are colonized suffer and don't remain colonized forever
While countries with democracy multiply the growth of prosperity by sheer numbers
Note the difference between a man with no divinity and a man with divinity, the one that beholds hero title of itself
Note that there are great men that colonized huge empires that do not exist anymore, but few heroes that took nothing yet changed millions minds of the world
No matter the results, democracy always wins even in worlds that today are still abundant

In abundant corporations, although the surface story seems that all departments or teams triumphantly share the same pie
That does not happen  
Because for some people, they do not expand that divinity and instead waste that divinity on less fruitful stuff
They don't share a blessing, they share a curse, a curse that will make the corporation less abundant instead to be more abundant to the world

I experienced a department that had a lot of blessings from people that had divinity within themselves
However, a clash of ideologies erupted to those who had the blessing and those who had not
On the one side, the blessed people could not follow their faith 
Their religion of amplifying the divinity of our world was not practiced
They were not cared of what they thought, nobody could listen
On the other side, the people who were not blessed were sensitive to their sensitivities, they wanted to follow their past world without divinity, a past world that was starting to collide now despite its sheer abundance

Most of the blessed people left for that department to share the great world of god because it was the duty to do so and now I am all left alone to see its misery
A department that was ranked the same as others is now at its pity compared to other departments that followed the right divinity
Oh might you! Who teached those children to become only man, but no heroes!? 
For there is many man who can be conceit and arrogant, but few heroes who care the collective level of the world!
For the people who are just man, but no heroes, I tell you: god gave you the opportunity to act rightly and you may never meet the same fate again to own such power
How everlasting your kingdom will last is between you transcending to be a hero or still keeping the arrogance and conceit of a man
It is between losing your old kingdom and your old past and creating a new one that is more befit for the world

But oh might you! You didn't think but you only do!
Like a politician, doing what they already do
And the more you do what you already do
The more miles away you are from the audience believing you are just a hero instead of an any man 
Oh might you! I feel pity why you had that arrogance and conceit from your past world

But I tell you, fear not for what you already have done
As god has mercy on you
For laws cannot be followed, but only learned
And one day, let shall cross our path, where I teach you to me, and you teach to me
For that is the real kingdom of god
As for today, I say to you, think before you do!
