### Oscar's Final Wish

_A fan-fictional account before the protagonist ventures along with his troops on the historical event of the storming of the Bastille._

Here is a letter corresponding to all who have known me in case I do not see the light of day passing by:

Everybody
<br>I am so grateful that you have all fought alongside me
<br>Without your support
<br>My words would not have any meaning
<br>Thanks for believing me in fighting for a greater cause

If you are reading this 
<br>It must have been so that I have passed away
<br>I already felt the loss of comrades I knew since childhood
<br>Although I could hardly bear what lied in front of my eyes
<br>I knew that was just a glimpse of all the fate within our commoners

This may be the end for me
<br>But it can be a beginning of something else.
<br>Do you hear those voices?
<br>Our commoners have already lost someone from hunger and torture
<br>And they cannot bear that pain anymore
<br>If our sworn duty is to protect our people
<br>What are we doing on behalf of them?
<br>If we cannot bear our own personal loss
<br>What right do we have to ignore the loss of others?
<br>Is it the nation that we stand for
<br>Suppose to be of joy and happiness
<br>And not of bitterness and sadness?

For all things considered
<br>Please do not blame yourselves
<br>After all, when I first started
<br>I was naive too
<br>I supported and protected the royal family my entire life
<br>And now I am fighting against it
<br>Hahaha!
<br>Is it not that ironic?

The truth is this is a human problem
<br>We always believe that our destiny is set from our birthright
<br>That a commoner will always be a commoner
<br>That a noble will always be a noble

But that is far from the truth
<br>Although I followed the steps of my noble father
<br>I was able to come here to stand for you today
<br>Is it not that proof
<br>That a person can have a change of heart?

Although I am now gone
<br>Your determination should not be at a loss
<br>Remember that our common people depend on us for their freedom
<br>When I saw my common people at peril
<br>It troubled me at first
<br>As a guard protecting the royal family
<br>I thought I was working for the greatest cause for my nation
<br>But I did not know it was wrong
<br>Because that is what my noble family always taught me
<br>But I did not see anything wrong 
<br>Because the noble separated the commoners in different districts
<br>The matters that I cared before are now laughable
<br>And the ones that I ignored before meaningful

Although we march gallantly
<br>Let us do so by also looking at the greatest cause
<br>Never let our duty only favor to whatever is currently conformed
<br>No matter the sacrifices that we must have to take
<br>Now go and show how proud we are for our nation!

Please have no worries.
<br>I am very confident our people will get our freedom one day.
<br>If any of you are still able to survive and raise a family
<br>Even if we live in a world full of peace
<br>Raise your children on finding the best cause to life
<br>Let us create new standards for our own nation
<br>A candle of light that does not fade out at night

<br>Adieu,
<br>Oscar
